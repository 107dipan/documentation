<h2 id="component-types">Component Types</h2>
<p>
  The container has a large number of different types of plug-ins available to a developer.
  To start creating components, see <a href="../vespa-plugins.html">Vespa Plugins</a>.
</p><p>
<img src="../img/container_components.svg">
</p><p>
  A client may or may not be a network client, so it is related to the network layer.
  The network layer associates a Request with a <a href="#response-handlers">response handler</a>
  and routes it to the correct type of <a href="#request-handlers">request handler</a>
  (typically based on URI binding patterns).
</p><p>
  If an application needs lightweight request-response processing
  using decomposition by a series of chained logical units,
  the <a href="../jdisc/processing.html">processing framework</a>
  is the correct family of components to use.
  The request will be routed from ProcessingHandler through one or more chains of
  <a href="#processor-instances">Processor</a> instances.
  The exact format of the output is customizable using a <a href="#renderers">Renderer</a>.
</p><p>
  If doing search queries, SearchHandler will create a Query object,
  route that to the pertinent chain of <a href="#searchers">Searcher</a> instances,
  and associate the returned Result with the correct <a href="#renderers">Renderer</a> instance
  for optional customization of the output format.
</p><p>
  The DocumentProcessingHandler is usually invoked from messagebus,
  and used for feeding documents into an index or storage.
  The incoming data is used to build a Document object,
  and this is then feed through a chain of <a href="#document-processors">DocumentProcessor</a> instances.
</p><p>
  If building an application with custom HTTP APIs, for instance arbitrary REST APIs,
  the easiest way is building a custom <a href="#request-handlers">RequestHandler</a>.
  This gets the Request, which is basically a set of key-value pairs,
  and returns a stream of arbitrary data back to the network.
</p><p>
  <a href="#components">Component</a> is the basic building block in the container.
  A component may be injected into other components,
  including all the different request handlers, document processors and so on mentioned above,
  and will get a destructor like method invoked when no other component is using it any more.
</p>


<table class="table">
  <tr id="request-handlers">
    <th>Request handlers</th>
    <td>
      <p>
        Request handlers are the easiest way to implement arbitrary REST services.
        The incoming request is a set of key-value pairs and protocol specific information.
        A request handler my fire off a request to e.g. the search handler,
        but what it will get back is opaque.
        If context sensitive result transformations are necessary,
        the request handler must be paired with one or more <a href="#searchers">searchers</a>,
        and if the output from the search needs to be customized,
        a <a href="#renderers">renderer</a> for the search result is the correct way of doing it
        (as opposed to trying to transform the search response in the request handler).
      </p><p>
        A request handler accepts a request, and returns a response.
        All applications will use a request handler, either by implementing their own,
        or indirectly by using the <a href="#processor-instances">processing framework</a>,
        as the processing handler is a request handler as well.
        A client provider is-a request handler.
      </p><p>
        Requests are modelled as key-value stores, as in many other systems,
        while responses are meta information (like HTTP status)
        and a binary stream of content (the <em>ContentChannel</em> API).
      </p><p>
        A content channel is the basic I/O building block of JDisc.
        It is conceptually similar to a stream,
        but the basic unit is the ByteBuffer instead of the native byte.
        A content channel will take ownership of a ByteBuffer written to it.
      </p>
    </td>

  <tr id="response-handlers">
    <th>Response handlers</th>
    <td>
      <p>
        Response handlers are invoked by the request handlers after the client response is created.
        The correct response handler is chosen from URI pattern bindings.
        A Response is a more or less opaque data structure,
        so a response handler is more suited to e.g. tracking return codes
        than doing deep result inspections.
      </p><p>
        The response handler is passed along with the request,
        it is <em>the link back to the external client</em>,
        as it contains the infrastructure for passing binary data back to the network.
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="processor-instances">
    <th>Processor instances</th>
    <td>
      <p>
        The <a href="../jdisc/processing.html">processing framework</a> is to be used for light-weight solutions
        where decomposition of the problem by partitioning the implementation into
        (a) chain(s) of processors is useful.
        Processors are invoked synchronously and the response is a tree of arbitrary data elements.
        Custom output formats is achieved by adding <a href="#renderers">renderers</a>.
      </p><p>
        Processing is a light-weight, low latency request-response framework
        built on decomposition by chaining.
        It is a multi-threaded API, each processor must be written thread safe.
      </p><p>
        As a request handler, a processor accepts a response and returns a response.
        There are two central differences in the processor API from request handler API.
        First of all, a processor may invoke other processors directly,
        as processors are organized in chains, like filters.
        Second, processing responses are structured trees, as opposed to a binary stream.
        This makes processors suited to both request and response transformation,
        as working on both the request and response is possible.
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="renderers">
    <th>Renderers</th>
    <td>
      <p>
        Renderers are result formatters for the processing and search frameworks in the container.
        They usually render responses as JSON or XML, but arbitrary MIME types may be used,
        including binary formats.
        Renderers are subclasses of
        <code><a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa/blob/master/container-core/src/main/java/com/yahoo/processing/rendering/Renderer.java">
        com.yahoo.processing.rendering.Renderer</a></code>.
      </p><p>
        As a processing response is a tree, there must be some way to transform that to a binary representation.
        To support multiple output formats, the marshalling work is placed in the plug-in type Renderer.
        A default JSON renderer is available.
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="searchers">
    <th>Searchers</th>
    <td>
      <p>
        Searchers are the only supported way of doing <em>structured</em> query
        and result transforms in a search context.
        If an application is performing searches and needs to look at single result documents (hits)
        or needs to add terms to the parsed query, searchers are the only way to do this robustly.
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="document-processors">
    <th>Document processors</th>
    <td>
      <p>
        Document processors are for documents what searchers are for queries.
        They can access and transform documents robustly and structured.
        If documents need some kind of transformations or annotations
        before reaching an index or storage,
        custom document processors are usually a better solution than manipulating the document feed.
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="components">
    <th>Components</th>
    <td>
      <p>
        Usually, any container plug-in is a component.
        A component is usually a subclass of com.yahoo.component.AbstractComponent,
        though com.yahoo.component.Component is an interface.
        Components are the low-level wirings for using composition with injection in the container.
        If building complex searchers or document processors,
        shared resources or simply partitioning the code, is often needed.
        The Component is an object with a controlled lifecycle which may be injected into other components,
        such as searchers, renderers, document processors and request handlers.
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="binding">
    <th>Binding</th>
    <td>
      <p>
        A binding is a pattern, or rule,
        matching a URI which is used to route incoming requests
        to the correct <a href="#filter">filter chain</a> or <a href="#request-handlers">request handler</a>,
        and route outgoing requests to the correct <a href="#client">client</a>.
        For instance, the binding <em>http://*/*</em> would match any HTTP request,
        while <em>http://*/processing</em> would only match that specific path.
        If several bindings match, the most specific one is chosen.
      </p>
      <table class="table">
        <tr id="server-binding">
          <th style="white-space:nowrap">Server binding</th>
          <td>
            A server binding is a rule for matching incoming requests to the correct request handler,
            basically the JDisc building block for implementing RESTful APIs
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="client-binding">
          <th>Client binding</th>
          <td>
            A client binding is a pattern which is used to match requests originating inside the container,
            e.g. when doing federation, to a client provider.
            That is, it is a rule which determines what code should handle a given outgoing request
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="filter">
    <th>Filter</th>
    <td>
      <p>
        A filter is a lightweight request checker.
        It may set some specific request property,
        or it may do security checking and simply block requests missing some mandatory property or header.
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="client">
    <th>Client</th>
    <td>
      <p>
        Clients, or client providers, are implementations of clients for different protocols,
        or special rules for given protocols.
        When a JDisc application acts as a client, e.g. fetches a web page from another host,
        it is a client provider that handles the transaction.
        Bindings are used, as with request handlers and filters, to choose the correct client,
        matching protocol, server, etc, and then hands off the request to the client provider.
        There is no problem in using arbitrary other types of clients
        for external services in processors and request handlers.
