<p>
vespa-feeder is a feeding client that parses
<a href="http://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/reference/document-json-format.html">JSON</a>
input as Vespa document operations and sends to a Vespa application.
File format is auto-detected. Use <em>vespa-feeder --help</em> for usage.
Typical use is:
<pre>
$ vespa-feeder mydocs.json
</pre>
The binary parses the content of the input sequentially, and feeds each operation in order.
However, since many operations will be pending at any one time, and because the
processing time of an operation varies, there is no guarantee as to
which order operations reach the backend. Because this can be very
important when it comes to operations that apply to the same document
id, there is logic in place to never send an operation for a document
id to which there is already a pending operation.
</p><p>
An option to note is <em>--abortondataerror</em>,
which can be set to <em>no</em> in case the input has errors (e.g. invalid characters).
<em>vespa-feeder</em> notifies on parsing errors at the end of the feed, but it will not abort.

<p>
At the end of the feed, <em>vespa-feeder</em> prints a report.
To print this report once a minute, use <em>--verbose</em> - sample output:
<pre>
Messages sent to vespa (route default) :
----------------------------------------
PutDocument: ok: 999997 msgs/sec: 411.38 failed: 0 <span style="background-color: yellow;">ignored: 0</span> latency(min, max, avg): 2, 4360, 99
</pre>
<em>ignored</em> reports the number of documents that could not be
routed to any <a href="services-content.html">content clusters</a> because they did not match any of the
<a href="services-content.html#documents">configured document types</a> or selections - examples are:
<ul>
  <li>
    A document type is removed from the application
    and the feed file contains documents with this type
  </li><li>
    One or more selection expressions restrict the documents the cluster accepts,
    and the feed file contains documents that are excluded.
    An example is feeding <a href="../search-definitions.html#document-expiry">expired documents</a> -
    a selection for documents that are less than 30 days old
    and the feed file contains documents that are 30+ days old.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
