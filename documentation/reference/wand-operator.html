title: "The WAND Operator"
---

<p>
This document gives an overview of use cases for Wand search operators that are available in Vespa.
All of these operators can be used for efficient top-k retrieval and are based on
<em>Weak AND</em> or <em>Weighted AND</em> as described by Broder et al in
<em>Efficient query evaluation using a two-level retrieval process</em>.
These are operators that scales adaptively from OR to AND.
The available operators are
<a href="advanced-search-operators.html#parallel-wand">Parallel Wand</a> and
<a href="advanced-search-operators.html#vespa-wand">Vespa Wand</a>.
These operators may be used directly using
<a href="../query-language.html">YQL</a>
or from a Java Searcher plugin. Take a look at
<a href="advanced-search-operators.html">Advanced Search Operators</a>
for description and characteristics of the Wand operators.
</p><p>
Use cases for a Wand operator arise when you have many query
terms that you would like to see matched with OR semantics,
but you are only interested in a small number of top hits for the query.
With the normal OR operator the cost rises very quickly with the number of terms,
so five terms inside OR may already be "many":
a simple rule of thumb is that the evaluation cost is proportional to
the number of hits the OR yields.
A Wand operator, in contrast, has a target for the number of hits you want it to produce,
and may throw away hits that are not good enough once it has produced enough hits.
</p><p>
If you are only interested in the best 100 hits (or less) from an OR,
a Wand operator should be a good match.
The basic idea is that after seeing enough hits,
the Wand algorithm will require that a document match more terms (or more relevant terms) in the query.
The operator may go all the way to requiring match on all terms if that gives many hits.
Note that since the behavior is adaptive you will always get at least the target number of hits,
usually many more. Example use cases:
<ul>
  <li>Make recommendations based on user history</li>
  <li>Find similar documents</li>
  <li>Find extra content for a web page that is relevant to the text on the page</li>
</ul>
Note that in the cases above you would extract a large number of words from user history,
from a document, or from some text you are going to display,
and then make a query with all those words as weak criteria,
looking for documents that contain as many of those words as possible,
optionally with extra weight on those words that are considered more important.

<h2 id="parallel-wand">Parallel Wand</h2>
<p>
Create a Parallel Wand using <a href="../query-language.html#wand">wand() in YQL</a>
or in a Java searcher plugin using the <code>com.yahoo.prelude.query.WandItem</code>.
The field to search must be a weighted set attribute with fast-search.
<p>


<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>
Lets imagine we have an application where we would like to search for popular blogs about cars
and we have the following search definition file.
The weighted set attribute <code>car_types</code> is used to tag an article
with which car types that are discussed in that article,
while the integer attribute <code>popularity</code>
is used to track the static popularity of that article.
We want to search the <code>car_types</code> field using Parallel Wand.
<p><p>
We also have two rank profiles:
<code>default</code> uses the raw dot product score that is calculated by Parallel Wand,
while <code>combined_score</code> combines the dot product score with the static popularity score:
<pre>
search article {
  document article {
    field car_types type weightedset&lt;string&gt; {
      indexing: attribute
      attribute: fast-search
    }
    field popularity type int {
      indexing: attribute | summary
    }
  }
  rank-profile default {
    first-phase {
      expression: rawScore(car_types)
    }
  }
  rank-profile combined_score {
    first-phase {
      expression: rawScore(car_types) + attribute(popularity)
    }
  }
}
</pre>
</p>


<h3 id="wand-in-yql">wand() in YQL</h3>
<p>
Lets imagine a particular user that is interested in Italian cars, especially sports cars.
This user would mainly like to get blogs discussing Italian sports cars,
but blogs about more usual Italian cars could also be returned.
In the following example we see how to use YQL to create a Parallel Wand for the
<code>car_types</code> field with 25 as the target number of hits to produce.
Notice that the weights for Italian sports cars are higher than for more usual cars.
<pre>
yql=select ignoredfield from ignoredsource where [ {"targetNumHits": 25} ]wand(car_types, {"pagani":400,"lamborghini":300,"maserati":250,"ferrari":150,"lancia":50,"alfa":40,"fiat":30});
</pre>
</p>


<h3 id="com.yahoo.prelude.query.WandItem">com.yahoo.prelude.query.WandItem</h3>
<p>
The same example Parallel Wand can be added in a Java searcher plugin:
<pre>
import com.yahoo.prelude.query.*;
import com.yahoo.search.Query;
import com.yahoo.search.Result;
import com.yahoo.search.query.QueryTree;
import com.yahoo.search.searchchain.Execution;

private Result hardCoded(Query query, Execution execution) {
    WandItem filter = new WandItem("car_types", 25);
    filter.addToken("pagini", 400);
    filter.addToken("lamborghini", 300);
    filter.addToken("maserati", 250);
    filter.addToken("ferrari", 150);
    filter.addToken("lancia", 50);
    filter.addToken("alfa", 40);
    filter.addToken("fiat", 30);
    QueryTree tree = query.getModel().getQueryTree();
    Item oldroot = tree.getRoot();
    AndItem newtop = new AndItem();
    newtop.addItem(oldroot);
    newtop.addItem(filter);
    tree.setRoot(newtop);
    query.trace("added hardcoded filter: ", true, 2);
    return execution.search(query);
}
</pre>
</p>


<h3 id="ranking-notes">Ranking notes</h3>
<p>
Note that when using the <code>default</code> rank profile in this example,
we are guaranteed to get the top-k hits
(according to the raw dot product score of the Parallel Wand)
in the final search result.
This is however not the case when using the <code>combined_score</code> rank profile.
In this case the top-k hits (according to the raw dot product score)
are also returned from the Parallel Wand in the match phase,
but in the ranking phase we also consider the static popularity score
which may alter what is the final top-k hits
according to the expression in the rank profile.
This means that when combining the raw dot product score of the Parallel Wand with something else
(in either a first phase or second phase rank expression),
you must ensure that these rank scores correlate somewhat.
When combining scores like this you also should tune the
<code>targetNumHits</code> used by the Parallel Wand.
