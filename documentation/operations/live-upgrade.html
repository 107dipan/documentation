<p>This document describes how to live-upgrade a Vespa system.
Follwing this procedure ensures that the upgrade can be accomplished
without disruption to read or write traffic.</p>


<ol>
  <li id="consider-before-upgrading"><strong>Consider before upgrading</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>If you are upgrading to a <b>new major version</b>, you should first upgrade to
        the latest version on the current major, then make sure there are no deprecation
        warnings when building and deploying your application.
      </li>
      <li>Redundancy: You should always have capacity to take one node per cluster out of service at the time.
        This procedure relies on that. If your content clusters have redundancy=1, or searchable-copies=1, you
        will have some data unavailability (reduced coverage) during live upgrade.</li>
      <li>To reduce node downtime, you can download the new Vespa version to all hosts in advance.
      <li>To reduce content node node downtime, consider
        use <a href="../reference/services-content.html#flush-on-shutdown">flush-on-shutdown</a>.
        This flushes the transaction before stopping nodes, which reduces startup time.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li id="upgrade-config-server"><strong>Upgrade config servers</strong>
    <ul><li>
      Detach all nodes from the
      config servers by running this command on all hosts:
      <pre class="brush: cli">$ vespa-configproxy-cmd -m setmode memorycache</pre>
      This causes services to keep their current configuration until both config
      server and the services themselves have been upgraded.
    </li><li>
      Install the new Vespa version on the config servers and restart them.
    </li><li>
      Redeploy and activate the application:
      <pre class="brush: cli">$ vespa-deploy prepare &lt;app&gt; &amp;&amp; vespa-deploy activate</pre>
    </li><li>
      Restart services on the config servers -
      the config proxy will then go back to using the default mode and
      serve config from the upgraded config servers.
    </li></ul>
  </li>

  <li id="upgrade-all-other-nodes-one-by-one"><strong>Upgrade all other nodes one by one</strong>
    For each of the other nodes in the system:
    <ul>
      <li>Stop Vespa services on the node.</li>
      <li>Install the new Vespa version.</li>
      <li>Start Vespa services on the node.</li>
      <li>Reattach the node to the config servers:
        <pre class="brush: cli">$ vespa-configproxy-cmd -m setmode default</pre>
      <li>Wait until the node is fully up before doing the next node.</li>
    </ul>

</ol>
