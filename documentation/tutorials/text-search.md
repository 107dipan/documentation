## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will guide you through the setup of a text search application built on top of Vespa. At the end you will be able to store text documents in Vespa and search them via text queries. The application built here will be the foundation to other tutorials that will add future improvements, such as creating ranking functions based on Machine Learning (ML) models. 

The goal here is to setup a text search app based on simple term-match features such as BM25 [TODO: Add reference?] or NativeRank [TODO: point to page]. In addition we will showcase how easy it is to switch and experiment with different ranking functions in Vespa. [TODO: Add a summary of the other things that will be discussed in the rest of the tutorial]

We will start by describing the dataset used in this tutorial ... [TODO: Introduce dataset specifics]
