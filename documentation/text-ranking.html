<p>
Refer to the <a href="ranking.html">ranking</a> introduction for Vespa ranking.
See the <a href="tutorials/text-search.html">text search</a> and
<a href="tutorials/text-search-ml.html">test search through ML</a> tutorials.
Also relevant is the guide for
<a href="semantic-qa-retrieval.html">Semantic Retrieval for Question Answering Applications</a>.

The default ranking is <code>nativeRank</code> in the first phase and no second phase re-ranking.
The <code>nativeRank</code> is a feature which gives a reasonably good rank score,
while being fast enough to be suitable for first phase ranking.
See the <a href="reference/nativerank.html">native rank reference</a> and
<a href="nativerank.html">native rank introduction</a> for more information.
</p></p>
An alternative to <code>nativeRank</code> is using the
<a href="reference/bm25.html">BM25</a> rank feature.

<h2 id="weight-significance-and-connectedness">Weight, significance and connectedness</h2>
<p>
Modify the values of the match features from the query
by sending weight, significance and connectedness with the query:
<table class="table">
  <thead></thead><tbody>
    <tr><th>Weight</th><td><p>
      Signify that some query terms are more or less important than others in matches.
      For example <code>query=large shoes!200</code> specifies that he term "shoes" <!-- ToDo: rewrite to YQL -->
      should be twice as important for the final rank score than "large"
      (since the default weight is 100).
      </p><p>
      Weight is used in <code><a href="reference/rank-features.html#fieldMatch(name).weight">
      fieldMatch(<em>name</em>).weight</a></code>, which can be multiplied with
      <code><a href="reference/rank-features.html#fieldMatch(name)">
      fieldMatch(<em>name</em>)</a></code> to yield a weighted score for the field,
      and in <code><a href="reference/rank-features.html#fieldMatch(name).weightedOccurrence">
      fieldMatch(<em>name</em>).weightedOccurrence</a></code>
      to get a occurrence score which is higher if higher weighted terms occurs most.
      Configure static field weights in the
      <a href="reference/search-definitions-reference.html#weight">search definition</a>.</p></td>
    </tr><tr><th>Significance</th><td><p>
      How rare a particular term is in the corpus or the language.
      This is sometimes valuable information because if a document matches a rare word,
      it might mean the document is more important than one which matches a common word.
      Significance is calculated automatically by Vespa during indexing,
      but can also be overridden by setting the significance values on the query terms
      in a <a href="searcher-development.html">Searcher component</a>.
      Significance is accessible in
      <code><a href="reference/rank-features.html#fieldMatch(name).significance">
      fieldMatch(<em>name</em>).significance</a></code>, which can be used the same way as weight.
      Weight and significance are also averaged into
      <code><a href="reference/rank-features.html#fieldMatch(name).importance">
      fieldMatch(<em>name</em>).importance</a></code> for convenience.</p></td>
    </tr><tr><th>Connectedness</th><td><p>
      Signify the degree of connection between adjacent terms in the query.
      For example, the query <code>new york newspaper</code> should have a higher connectedness
      between the terms "new" and "york" than between "york" and "newspaper" to rank documents higher
      if they contain "new york" as a phrase.
      Term connectedness is taken into account by
      <code><a href="reference/rank-features.html#fieldMatch(name).proximity">
      fieldMatch(<em>name</em>).proximity</a></code>,
      which is also an important contribution to
      <code><a href="reference/rank-features.html#fieldMatch(name)">fieldMatch(<em>name</em>)</a></code>.
      Connectedness is a normalized value which is 0.1 by default.
      It must be set by a custom Searcher,
      looking up connectivity information from somewhere - there is no query syntax for it.</p></td>
