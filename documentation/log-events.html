<p>
Event messages are log messages of the <em>event</em> type. Events
contain a well-defined payload which makes them suitable for
automated processing of various kinds, like alerting. An event
is emitted by a component when something of interest happens to it, or
when it has some metric data it wants to share with the world. As all
other log messages, events are collected to the admin nodes by the
logserver component, where they may be found in the Vespa log or
intercepted programmatically by a logserver plugin.
</p><p>
Metrics are used to report on internal variables detailing the
processing performed by a particular component. <em>VALUES</em> are numbers
with momentarily significance, such as queue lengths and
latencies. <em>COUNTER</em> are numbers increasing monotonically with each
processing step, such as number of documents processes, or number of
queries.
</p>

<h2 id="event-format">Event format</h2>
<p>
Each event has an event type, a version and an optional payload.
</p>

<p>
In the log format, event types are expressed as a single word,
versions as a simple integer, and the payload as a set
of <em>key=value</em> pairs.
</p>

<p>
The event payload is backslash-quoted just like log messages are in
general. This means that events may be double-quoted during
transport. Double-quote delimiters are not supported.
</p>

These are the supported event types and their usage. You can find more
details about each of the event types further below.

<dl>
  <dt>Event: starting</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Payload: <em>name=&lt;name&gt;</em></p>

    <p>This event is sent by processes when they are about to start another
    process. Typical for, but not limited to, shell scripts. This event
    is not required to track processes, but is useful in cases where a
    sub-process may fail during startup. Example:</p>
    <pre>starting qrserver for default/container.0</pre>
  </dd>

  <dt>Event: started</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Payload: <em>name=&lt;name&gt;</em></p>

    <p>The <em>started</em> event is sent by a service that just started up. Example:</p>
    <pre>started/1 name=&quot;vespa-proton&quot;</pre>
  </dd>

  <dt>Event: stopping</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Payload: <em>name=&lt;name&gt; why=&lt;why&gt;</em></p>

    <p>The <em>stopping</em> event is sent by a process that is about to exit. Example:</p>
    <pre>stopping/1 name=&quot;vespa-proton&quot; why=&quot;clean shutdown&quot;</pre>
  </dd>

  <dt>Event: stopped</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Payload: <em>name=&lt;name&gt; pid=&lt;pid&gt;
    exitcode=&lt;exitcode&gt;</em></p>

    <p>This event is sent by a process monitoring when a sub-process exits. Example:</p>
    <pre>stopped/1 name=&quot;searchnode&quot; pid=14523 exitcode=0</pre>
  </dd>

  <dt>Event: crash</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Payload: <em>name=&lt;name&gt; pit=&lt;pid&gt;
    signal=&lt;signal&gt;</em></p>

    <p>Submitted by a process monitoring a sub-process when the sub-process
    crashes (dumps core etc.). Example:</p>
    <pre>crash/1 name=&quot;vespa-proton&quot; pid=12345 signal=11</pre>
  </dd>

  <dt>Event: count</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Payload: <em>name=&lt;name&gt; value=&lt;value&gt;</em></p>

    <p>General event for counts. The
    <em>name</em> is specific to each library/application. Counters are assumed
    to increase with time, counting the number of events since the program
    was started. Example:</p>
    <pre>count/1 name=&quot;queries&quot; value=10</pre>
  </dd>

  <dt>Event: value</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Payload: <em>name=&lt;name&gt; value=&lt;value&gt;</em></p>

    <p>General event for values. <em>Value is for values that cannot be
    counts</em>. Typical values are queue lengths, transaction frequencies and so
    on. Example:</p>
    <pre>value/1 name=&quot;peak_qps&quot; value=200</pre>
  </dd>

  <dt>Event: state</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Payload: <em>name=&lt;name&gt; value=&lt;value&gt;</em></p>

    <p>General event for components in a process.
    <em>value</em> contains a string with more detailed information on what has happened.
    Note that the format and content of such strings can change between releases. Example:</p>
    <pre>state/1 name=&quot;transactionlog.replay.start&quot; value=&quot;{&quot;domain&quot;:&quot;test&quot;,&quot;serialnum&quot;:{&quot;first&quot;:1,&quot;last&quot;:1000}}&quot;</pre>
  </dd>
