<p>
Vespa accepts unstructured human input and structured queries for application logic separately,
then combines them into a single data structure for executing.
Human input is parsed heuristically, while application queries are formulated in YQL.
</p><p>
A simple query URL looks like:
<pre>
http://myhost.mydomain.com:8080/search/?yql=select%20%2A%20from%20sources%20%2A%20where%20text%20contains%20%22blues%22%3B
</pre>
In other words, <em>yql</em> contains:
<pre class="urlunencode" oncopy="">
select%20%2A%20from%20sources%20%2A%20where%20text%20contains%20%22blues%22%3B
</pre>
This matches all documents where the field named <em>text</em> contains the word <em>blues</em>.
</p><p>

<a href="reference/query-language-reference.html">query language reference</a>.

<h2 id="equiv">equiv</h2>
<p>
EQUIV is a query operator that can be used to add synonyms
for words where the various synonyms should be equivalent.
The typical use case is something like:
<ul>
  <li>The user's query is something like <code>(used AND automobile)</code></li>
  <li>We somehow - probably by using a dictionary - have
      knowledge that <em>automobile</em> is a synonym for <em>car</em></li>
  <li>We rewrite the query to <code>(used AND (automobile EQUIV car))</code></li>
  <li>We do not care if a document contains <em>automobile</em> or <em>car</em>,
      they are equivalent.
      We want the query to behave as if all occurrences of <em>car</em> in the document corpus
      had been replaced by <em>automobile</em>
      and we were running the original query <code>(used AND automobile)</code></li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3 id="difference-from-or-operator">Difference from OR operator</h3>
<p>
See the <a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#equiv">reference</a>
for differences between OR and EQUIV.
In many cases it might be more correct to use OR instead of EQUIV.
When looking for an entity like Sean <em>Diddy</em> Combs this might look appropriate:
<pre>
"Diddy" EQUIV "Sean Combs" EQUIV "Sean John" EQUIV "Puff Daddy" EQUIV "P. Diddy"
</pre>
But <em>Diddy</em> is used by other people - even other pop
artists - so matching that alone is not a sure hit for the entity
we are looking for, and finding more than one of the synonyms in the
same text would give better confidence.
This is exactly what OR does, so something like:
<pre>
"Diddy"!20 OR "Sean Combs"!75 OR "Sean John"!75 OR "Puff Daddy"!80 OR "P. Diddy"!60 OR "Sean John Combs"!100
</pre>
might be better, with lower weights on the alternatives giving less confidence.
If it looks like the many words and phrases inside the OR
overwhelms other words in the query, giving even lower weights may be useful,
for example making the sum of weights 100 - the default weight for just one alternative.
</p>


<h3 id="how-to-use">How to use</h3>
<p>
The decision to use EQUIV must be taken by application-specific dictionary or linguistics use.
This can be done from <a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#equiv">YQL</a>
or from a container plugin where the query object can be manipulated as follows:
<ul>
  <li>Find a word item in the query</li>
  <li>Check that an EQUIV can be used in that place
      (see <a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#equiv">limitations</a>)</li>
  <li>Find the synonyms in the dictionary</li>
  <li>Make word items for the synonyms</li>
  <li>Make an <code>EquivItem</code> with the synonyms (and the
      original word) as children</li>
  <li>Replace the original <code>WordItem</code> with the new <code>EquivItem</code></li>
</ul>
For ideas on how the code might look there is
<a href="http://javadoc.io/page/com.yahoo.vespa/container-search/latest/com/yahoo/prelude/query/EquivItem.html">javadoc</a>
available, with a typical insertion of <code>EquivItem</code> looking like this:
</p>
<pre>
private Item equivize(Item item) {
    if (item instanceof TermItem) {
        String word = ((TermItem)item).stringValue();

        // lookup word in dictionary:
        DictEntry entry = dict.get(word);

        // if synonyms found, make equiv and replace this word:
        if (entry != null) {
            EquivItem eq = new EquivItem(item, entry.synonyms);
            return eq;
        }
    } else if (item instanceof PhraseItem ||
               item instanceof PhraseSegmentItem) {
        // cannot put EQUIV inside PHRASE
        return item;
    } else if (item instanceof CompositeItem) {
        CompositeItem cmp = (CompositeItem)item;
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; cmp.getItemCount(); ++i) {
            cmp.setItem(i, equivize(cmp.getItem(i)));
        }
        return cmp;
    }
    return item;
}
</pre>



<h2 id="dotproduct">dotProduct</h2>
<p>
Refer to the <a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#dotproduct">dotProduct</a> reference.
<em>dotProduct</em> calculates the dot product of a weighted set in the query and a weighted set in a field -
and stores the result in <a href="ranking.html#raw-scores-and-query-item-labeling">raw scores</a>,
which is used in ranking expressions.
</p><p>
Use a weighted set field (use <a href="attributes.html">attribute</a> with <em>fast-search</em> for higher performance)
in the document to store the tokens:
<pre>
field features type weightedset&lt;string&gt; {
    indexing: summary | attribute
    attribute: fast-search
}
</pre>
The query needs to be prepared by a custom searcher or sent
using <a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#dotproduct">YQL</a>.
The code below shows the relevant part.
If using multiple dot products in the same query it is a good idea to label them.
This enables us to use individual dot product scores when ranking results later.
<pre>
Item makeDotProduct(String label, String field, Map&lt;String, Integer&gt; token_map) {
    DotProductItem item = new DotProductItem(field);
    item.setLabel(label);
    for (Map.Entry&lt;String, Integer&gt; entry : token_map.entrySet()) {
        item.addToken(entry.getKey(), entry.getValue());
    }
    return item;
}
</pre>
<em>dotProduct</em> produces
<a href="ranking.html#raw-scores-and-query-item-labeling">raw scores</a>
that can be used in a ranking expression.
The simplest approach is to use the sum of all raw scores for the field containing the tokens:
<pre>
rank-profile default {
    first-phase {
        expression: rawScore(features)
    }
}
</pre>
For better control, label each dot product in the query and use their scores individually:
<pre>
rank-profile default {
    first-phase {
        expression: itemRawScore(dp1) + itemRawScore(dp2)
    }
}
</pre>
</p>



<h2 id="weightedset">weightedSet</h2>
<p>
Refer to the <a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#weightedset">weightedSet</a> reference.
The use cases for <em>weightedSet</em> are for limiting the search result
to documents with specific properties that can have a large number of distinct values, like:
<ul>
  <li>We know who the user is, and want to restrict to documents
      written by one of the user's friends</li>
  <li>We have the topic area the user is interested in, and want to
      restrict to the top-ranked authors for this topic</li>
  <li>We have recorded the documents that have been clicked by users
      in the last 10 minutes, and want to search only in these</li>
</ul>
Note that in most actual use cases,
the field we are searching in is some sort of user ID, topic ID, group ID, or document ID
and can often be modeled as a number -
usually in a field of type <code>long</code>
(or <code>array&lt;long&gt;</code> if multiple values are needed).
If a string field is used, it will usually also be some sort of ID;
if you have data in a string field intended for searching with WeightedSetItem,
then using <code>match: word</code> for that field is recommended.
</p><p>
The decision to use a <code>WeightedSetItem</code> must be taken by application-specific logic.
This must be in the form of a Container plugin where the query object can be manipulated as follows:
<ul>
  <li>Decide if <code>WeightedSetItem</code> should be used</li>
  <li>Create a new <code>WeightedSetItem</code> for the field you want to use as filter</li>
  <li>Find the tokens and optionally weights to insert into the set</li>
  <li>Combine new <code>WeightedSetItem</code> with the original query by using an <code>AndItem</code></li>
</ul>
A simple code example adding a hardcoded filter containing 10 tokens:
<pre>
private Result hardCoded(Query query, Execution execution) {
    WeightedSetItem filter = new WeightedSetItem("author");
    filter.addToken("magazine1", 2);
    filter.addToken("magazine2", 2);
    filter.addToken("magazine3", 2);
    filter.addToken("tv", 3);
    filter.addToken("tabloid1", 1);
    filter.addToken("tabloid2", 1);
    filter.addToken("tabloid3", 1);
    filter.addToken("tabloid4", 1);
    filter.addToken("tabloid5", 1);
    filter.addToken("tabloid6", 1);
    QueryTree tree = query.getModel().getQueryTree();
    Item oldroot = tree.getRoot();
    AndItem newtop = new AndItem();
    newtop.addItem(oldroot);
    newtop.addItem(filter);
    tree.setRoot(newtop);
    query.trace("FriendFilterSearcher added hardcoded filter: ", true, 2);
    return execution.search(query);
}
</pre>
The biggest challenge here is finding the tokens to insert;
normally the incoming search request URL should not contain all the tokens directly.
For example, the search request could contain the user id,
and a lookup (in a database or a Vespa index) would fetch the friends list.
</p><p>
Since the tokens are inserted directly into the query
without going through the Search Container query parsing and query handling,
they won't be subject to transforms such as lowercasing, stemming, or phrase generation.
This means that if the field is a string field you'll need to insert lowercased tokens only,
and only single tokens in the index can be matched.
</p><p>

<a href="http://javadoc.io/page/com.yahoo.vespa/container-search/latest/com/yahoo/prelude/query/WeightedSetItem.html">container javadoc</a> available.

<h2 id="wand">wand</h2>
<p>
The field to search must be a weighted set attribute with fast-search.
Refer to the <a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#wand">wand</a> reference.
</p>


<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>
Lets imagine we have an application where we would like to search for popular blogs about cars
and we have the following search definition file.
The weighted set attribute <code>car_types</code> is used to tag an article
with which car types that are discussed in that article,
while the integer attribute <code>popularity</code>
is used to track the static popularity of that article.
We want to search the <code>car_types</code> field using
<a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#wand">wand</a>.
<p><p>
We also have two rank profiles:
<code>dotproductonly</code> uses the raw dot product score that is calculated by <em>wand</em>,
while <code>combined_score</code> combines the dot product score with the static popularity score:
<pre>
search article {
  document article {
    field car_types type weightedset&lt;string&gt; {
      indexing: attribute
      attribute: fast-search
    }
    field popularity type int {
      indexing: attribute | summary
    }
  }
  rank-profile dotproductonly {
    first-phase {
      expression: rawScore(car_types)
    }
  }
  rank-profile combined_score {
    first-phase {
      expression: rawScore(car_types) + attribute(popularity)
    }
  }
}
</pre>
</p>


<h3 id="query">Query</h3>
<p>
Lets imagine a particular user that is interested in Italian cars, especially sports cars.
This user would mainly like to get blogs discussing Italian sports cars,
but blogs about more usual Italian cars could also be returned.
In the following example we see how to use YQL to create a <em>wand</em> for the
<code>car_types</code> field with 25 as the target number of hits to produce.
Notice that the weights for sports cars are higher than for others.
<pre>
yql=select ignoredfield from ignoredsource where [ {"targetNumHits": 25} ]
 wand(car_types, {"pagani":400,"lamborghini":300,"maserati":250,"ferrari":150,"lancia":50,"alfa":40,"fiat":30});
</pre>
</p>
<p>
The same can be added in a Searcher plugin using
<a href="http://javadoc.io/page/com.yahoo.vespa/container-search/latest/com/yahoo/prelude/query/WandItem.html">WandItem</a>:
<pre>
import com.yahoo.prelude.query.*;
import com.yahoo.search.Query;
import com.yahoo.search.Result;
import com.yahoo.search.query.QueryTree;
import com.yahoo.search.searchchain.Execution;

private Result hardCoded(Query query, Execution execution) {
    WandItem filter = new WandItem("car_types", 25);
    filter.addToken("pagini", 400);
    filter.addToken("lamborghini", 300);
    filter.addToken("maserati", 250);
    filter.addToken("ferrari", 150);
    filter.addToken("lancia", 50);
    filter.addToken("alfa", 40);
    filter.addToken("fiat", 30);
    QueryTree tree = query.getModel().getQueryTree();
    Item oldroot = tree.getRoot();
    AndItem newtop = new AndItem();
    newtop.addItem(oldroot);
    newtop.addItem(filter);
    tree.setRoot(newtop);
    query.trace("added hardcoded filter: ", true, 2);
    return execution.search(query);
}
</pre>
</p>


<h3 id="ranking-notes">Ranking notes</h3>
<p>
Note that when using the <code>default</code> rank profile in this example,
we are guaranteed to get the top-k hits
(according to the raw dot product score) in the final search result.
This is however not the case when using the <code>combined_score</code> rank profile.
In this case the top-k hits (according to the raw dot product score)
are also returned from the <em>wand</em> in the match phase,
but in the ranking phase we also consider the static popularity score
which may alter what is the final top-k hits
according to the expression in the rank profile.
This means that when combining the raw dot product score of the <em>wand</em> with something else
(in either a first phase or second phase rank expression),
you must ensure that these rank scores correlate somewhat.
When combining scores like this you also should tune the
<code>targetNumHits</code> used by the <em>wand</em>.
</p>


<h3 id="tuning-target-number-of-hits">Tuning target number of hits</h3>
<p>
When using <em>wand</em> via YQL or a Java Searcher plugin,
one can specify the target for minimum number of hits the operator should produce.
By default, set <code>targetNumHits</code> equal to the number of hits to return.
If additional second phase ranking with rerank-count is used,
do not set <code>targetNumHits</code> less than the configured rank-profile's rerank-count.
Note that if you combine <em>wand</em> with a ranking expression that does not use its raw score,
the tuning of <code>targetNumHits</code> should follow the
<a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#weakand">weakAnd</a> guide lines.
</p>


<h3 id="tuning-score-threshold">Tuning Score Threshold</h3>
<p>
A score threshold can be specified when using <em>wand</em>.
The internal dot product score for a document must be larger than <code>scoreThreshold</code>
in order to be considered a match. Default value is 0.0.
</p>



<h2 id="weakand">weakAnd</h2>
<p>
<a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#weakand">weakAnd</a>
is a search operator that also implements the <em>Weak AND/Weighted AND</em> algorithm.
</p><p>
When using <em>weakAnd</em> via YQL or a Java Searcher plugin,
specify the target for minimum number of hits the operator should produce.
The effect of tuning <code>targetNumHits</code> may not be very intuitive.
To ensure that you get the best hits possible with a <em>weakAnd</em>,
set the target number somewhat higher than the number of hits returned to the user;
setting it 10 times higher should be more than enough.
The reason for increasing the target number is that <em>weakAnd</em>
uses a very simple ranking function internally to filter away bad hits.
If the normal rank expression correlates poorly with this internal filtering formula,
increase the target number.
The easiest is probably to use the default number (100) and see if that gives good results,
only tuning if you see a problem.
Also note that if the rank correlates poorly with the filtering criteria,
<em>weakAnd</em> may not be a good operator.
</p><p>
Anything similar to classic vector model ranking will work well with <em>weakAnd</em>.
We suggest using the <code>nativeFieldMatch</code> or <code>nativeDotProduct</code> feature as a starting point.
Note that because <em>weakAnd</em> relies on feedback
identifying which hits are used for first phase ranking to increase its threshold for what's considered a good hit,
the special <code>unranked</code> rank profile (which turns off ranking completely)
may cause <em>weakAnd</em> queries to become slower than a more normal ranking.
</p>


<h3 id="wand-notes">Wand notes</h2>
<p>
The available operators are
<a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#wand">wand</a> and
<a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#weakand">weakAnd</a>.
These are operators that scales adaptively from
<a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#or">or</a> to
<a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#and">and</a>.
</p><p>
Use cases for a Wand operator arise when you have many query
terms that you would like to see matched with OR semantics,
but you are only interested in a small number of top hits for the query.
With the normal OR operator the cost rises very quickly with the number of terms,
so five terms inside OR may already be "many":
a simple rule of thumb is that the evaluation cost is proportional to the number of hits the OR yields.
A Wand operator, in contrast, has a target for the number of hits you want it to produce,
and may throw away hits that are not good enough once it has produced enough hits.
</p><p>
If you are only interested in the best 100 hits (or less) from an OR,
a Wand operator should be a good match.
The basic idea is that after seeing enough hits,
the Wand algorithm will require that a document match more terms (or more relevant terms) in the query.
The operator may go all the way to requiring match on all terms if that gives many hits.
Note that since the behavior is adaptive you will always get at least the target number of hits,
usually many more. Example use cases:
<ul>
  <li>Make recommendations based on user history</li>
  <li>Find similar documents</li>
  <li>Find extra content for a web page that is relevant to the text on the page</li>
</ul>
Note that in the cases above you would extract a large number of words from user history,
from a document, or from some text you are going to display,
and then make a query with all those words as weak criteria,
looking for documents that contain as many of those words as possible,
optionally with extra weight on those words that are considered more important.
