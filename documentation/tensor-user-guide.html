    href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/tree/master/basic-search-tensor">tensor
sample app</a>, and in the following relevant links will be provided into that application.
</p>

<p>
For a quick introduction to what tensors are about, please refer to <a
    href="tensor-intro.html">Introduction to working with tensors in Vespa</a>.
Also refer to <a href="reference/tensor.html">the tensor reference guide</a> for more details.
</p>

<h2 id="tensor-document-fields">Tensor document fields</h2>

<p> In typical use, each document would contain one or more tensor fields to be
used during ranking. For example:</p>

<pre>
field tensor_attribute type tensor(x{}) {
    indexing: attribute | summary
    attribute: tensor(x{})
}
</pre>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/blob/master/basic-search-tensor/src/main/application/searchdefinitions/music.sd#L31-L34">Link to sample app</a>
</p>

<p>
This sets up a tensor field called <code>tensor_attribute</code>. Each tensor
requires a type, and here the type defines that the tensor contains one sparse
dimensions, <code>x</code> (a sparse vector). Tensors can't be used
in searching, only during ranking.
</p>

<p>For more details on setting up tensor fields, please refer to <a
    href="reference/search-definitions-reference.html#type:tensor">
the tensor field</a> in the search definition documentation. For more details
on tensor types, refer to <a
href="reference/search-definitions-reference.html#tensor-type-spec">
the tensor type reference</a>.
</p>


<h2 id="feeding-tensors-to-vespa">Feeding tensors to Vespa</h2>

<p>
After setting up the tensor fields in the search definition, feeding tensors are fairly straight forward. Basically,
you have two options.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Feed tensors directly using the tensor JSON format.</li>
    <li>Convert some other field, for instance a vector of floats, to a tensor during document processing using the tensor Java API.</li>
</ul>

<p>
To convert to tensors during document processing, please refer to <a
    href="#tensor-java-api">the tensor Java API</a>.
</p>

<p>
To feed to the <code>tensor_attribute</code> field we defined above, we use the JSON format:
</p>

<pre>
{
    "fields": {
        "tensor_attribute": {
            "cells": [
                { "address" : { "x" : "0" }, "value": 1.0 },
                { "address" : { "x" : "1" }, "value": 2.0 },
                { "address" : { "x" : "2" }, "value": 3.0 },
                { "address" : { "x" : "3" }, "value": 5.0 }
            ]
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/blob/master/basic-search-tensor/music-data-1.json#L8-L15">Link to sample app</a>
</p>

<p>
The field <code>x</code> is sparse, so the indices can be any
textual value as can be seen in the JSON above. For dense dimensions, the
indices are required to be numeric. For more details about the JSON format,
please refer to
    <a href="reference/document-json-put-format.html#tensor">
    the tensor JSON format
    </a>
in the document JSON put format documentation.
</p>


<h2 id="querying-vespa-with-tensors">Querying Vespa with tensors</h2>

<p>
Typically, we would like to pass a tensor down with the query to be used during ranking. This tensor can either be supplied in the actual
query string directly, or constructed from some other data or data source. In the latter case, please refer to <a
    href="#tensor-java-api">the tensor Java API</a> for details on how to construct tensors programmatically.
</p>

<p>
A tensor can be constructed directly from the tensor <a href="reference/tensor.html">literal form</a>. The corresponding literal form
of the tensor above is:
</p>

{% raw %}
<pre>
{{x:0}: 1.0, {x:1}: 2.0, {x:2}: 3.0, {x:3}: 5.0}
</pre>
{% endraw %}

<p>
This can be used in a query string by url encoding it:
</p>

<pre>
http://host:port/search/?query=sddocname:music&amp;tensor=%7B%7Bx%3A0%7D%3A1.0%2C%7Bx%3A1%7D%3A2.0%2C%7Bx%3A2%7D%3A3.0%2C%7Bx%3A3%7D%3A5.0%7D
</pre>

<p>
To use this tensor to ranking, there are two things you need to do:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Add the tensor to the query as a rank feature.</li>
    <li>Define the tensor type of the rank feature.</li>
</ul>

<p>
To add the tensor to the query as a rank feature, you need to add some code to a custom searcher as follows:
</p>

<pre>
public class ExampleTensorSearcher extends Searcher {

    @Override
    public Result search(Query query, Execution execution) {
        Object tensorProperty = query.properties().get("tensor");
        if (tensorProperty != null) {
            Tensor tensor = Tensor.from(tensorProperty.toString());
            query.getRanking().getFeatures().put("query(tensor)", tensor);
        }
        return execution.search(query);
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/blob/master/basic-search-tensor/src/main/java/com/yahoo/example/ExampleTensorSearcher.java">Link to sample app</a>
</p>

<p>
This grabs the value of the <code>tensor</code> query parameter, and constructs a
<code>com.yahoo.tensor.Tensor</code> object directly from the value. It then adds this object
to the query as a rank feature. You can also create the Tensor object programmatically.
Please refer to <a href="#tensor-java-api">the tensor Java API</a> for details.
</p>

<p>
Vespa needs to know the type of the <code>query(tensor)</code> rank feature for
it to be used in ranking. This is defined using a
<a href="query-profiles.html#query-profile-types">query profile type</a>.
As explained there, we create a new file <code>search/query-profiles/types/root.xml</code> in the
application package with the following content:

<pre>
&lt;query-profile-type id="root" inherits="native"&gt;
    &lt;field name="ranking.features.query(tensor)" type="tensor(x{})" /&gt;
&lt;/query-profile-type&gt;
</pre>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/blob/master/basic-search-tensor/src/main/application/search/query-profiles/types/root.xml">Link to sample app</a>
</p>

<p>
This tells the ranking backend that the rank feature named
<code>query(tensor)</code> will have type <code>tensor(x{})</code>, enabling the backend to
effectively compile expressions that use this feature.
</p>


<h2 id="ranking-with-tensors">Ranking with tensors</h2>

<p>
Tensors are used during ranking to modify a document's rank score given the
query. Typical operations are dot products between tensors of order 1
(vectors), or matrix products between tensors of order 2 (matrices). Tensors
are used in <a href="reference/ranking-expressions.html">rank expressions</a>
as rank features. Above, we have defined two rank features:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>attribute(tensor_attribute)</code>: the tensor associated with the document.</li>
    <li><code>query(tensor)</code>: the tensor sent with the query.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These can be used in rank expressions, with the caveat that the final rank
score of a document must resolve into a single double value. An example is the
following:
</p>

<pre>
rank-profile dot_product {
    first-phase {
        expression: sum(query(tensor)*attribute(tensor_attribute))
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/blob/master/basic-search-tensor/src/main/application/searchdefinitions/music.sd#L43-L47">Link to sample app</a>
</p>


<p>
This takes the product of the query tensor and the document tensor, and sums
all fields thus resolving into a single value which is used as the rank score.
In the case above, the value is <code>39.0</code>.
</p>


<p>
There are some <a href="reference/ranking-expressions.html#built-in-functions">ranking functions</a>
that are specifically used for tensors:
</p>

<table class="table">
  <thead></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>map(tensor, f(x)(...))</td> <td>Returns a new tensor with the lambda function defined in <code>f(x)(...)</code> applied to each cell.</td></tr>
<tr><td>reduce(tensor, aggregator, dim1, dim2, ...)</td> <td>Returns a new tensor with the <code>aggregator</code> applied across dimensions dim1, dim2, etc. If no dimensions are specified, reduce over all dimensions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>join(tensor1, tensor2, f(x,y)(...))</td> <td>Returns a new tensor constructed from the <em>natural join</em> between <code>tensor1</code> and <code>tensor2</code>, with the resulting cells having the value as calculated from <code>f(x,y)(...)</code>, where <code>x</code> is the cell value from <code>tensor1</code> and <code>y</code> from <code>tensor2</code>.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
These primitives allow for a great deal of flexibility when combined. The above rank expression is equivalently:
</p>

<pre>
rank-profile dot_product {
    first-phase {
        expression {
            reduce(
                join(
                    query(tensor),
                    attribute(tensor_attribute),
                    f(x,y)(x * y)
                ),
                sum
            )
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
...and represents the general dot product for tensors of any order.  Details about tensor
ranking functions including lambda expression and available aggregators can be found in
the <a href="reference/tensor.html">tensor reference documentation</a>.
More examples of tensor expression can be found in the <a href="tensor-intro.html">tensor introduction</a>.

</p>

<h2 id="constant-tensors">Constant tensors</h2>

<p>
In addition to document tensors and query tensors, Vespa has the feature of
distributing tensors along with the application package. This is useful for the
case when you have constant tensors to be used in ranking expressions, for
instance when you have machine learned models.
</p>

<p>
The following example shows how to define a constant tensor:
</p>

<pre>
constant tensor_constant {
    file: constants/constant_tensor_file.json
    type: tensor(x{})
}
</pre>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/blob/master/basic-search-tensor/src/main/application/searchdefinitions/music.sd#L38-L41">Link to sample app</a>
</p>

<p> This defines a new tensor rank feature with the type as defined and the
contents distributed with the application package in the file
<em>constants/constant_tensor_file.json</em>. The format of this file is
<a href="reference/document-json-put-format.html#tensor"> the tensor JSON format</a>,
see <a href="reference/search-definitions-reference.html#constant">example</a>.</p>

<p>
To use this tensor in a rank expression, encapsulate the constant name
with <code>constant(...)</code>:
</p>

<pre>
rank-profile use_constant_tensor {
    first-phase {
        expression: sum(query(tensor) * attribute(tensor_attribute) * constant(tensor_constant))
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/blob/master/basic-search-tensor/src/main/application/searchdefinitions/music.sd#L49-L53">Link to sample app</a>
</p>

<p>
The above expression combines three tensors: the query tensor, the document
tensor and a constant tensor. For more details, please refer to the <a
    href="reference/search-definitions-reference.html#constant">tensor constant
documentation</a> in the search definition documentation.
</p>

<h2 id="tensor-java-api">Tensor Java API</h2>

The Tensor API <a href="http://javadoc.io/page/com.yahoo.vespa/vespajlib/latest/com/yahoo/tensor/Tensor.html">javadoc can be found here</a>.

<h2>Common Use Cases</h2>
In the following section we describe some common use cases that can be solved using tensor operations.

<h4>Dot Product between query and document vectors</h4>
<p>
Assume we have a set of documents where each document contains a vector of size 4.
We want to calculate the dot product between the document vectors and a vector passed down with the query
and rank the results according to the dot product score.
</p>

<p>
The following sd-file defines an attribute tensor field with a tensor type that has one indexed dimension
<code>x</code> of size 4. In addition we define a rank profile that calculates the dot product.
</p>

<pre>
search example {
  document example {
    field document_vector type tensor(x[4]) {
      indexing: attribute | summary
      attribute: tensor(x[4])
    }
  }
  rank-profile dot_product {
    first-phase {
      expression: sum(query(query_vector)*attribute(document_vector))
    }
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
The tensor to pass down with query is defined in a query profile type with the same tensor type as the field in the document:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;query-profile-type id="myProfileType"&gt;
  &lt;field name="ranking.features.query(query_vector)" type="tensor(x[4])" /&gt;
&lt;/query-profile-type&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Example document with the vector [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0]:
</p>

<pre>
[
  { "put": "id:example:example::0", "fields": {
      "document_vector" : {
        "cells": [
          { "address" : { "x" : "0" }, "value": 1.0 },
          { "address" : { "x" : "1" }, "value": 2.0 },
          { "address" : { "x" : "2" }, "value": 3.0 },
          { "address" : { "x" : "3" }, "value": 5.0 }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
]
</pre>

<p>
Example query set in a searcher with the vector [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0]:
</p>

<pre>
public Result search(Query query, Execution execution) {
    query.getRanking().getFeatures().put("query(query_vector)",
        Tensor.Builder.of(TensorType.fromSpec("tensor(x[4])")).
        cell().label("x", 0).value(1.0).
        cell().label("x", 1).value(2.0).
        cell().label("x", 2).value(3.0).
        cell().label("x", 3).value(5.0).build());
    return execution.search(query);
}
</pre>


<h4>Matrix Product between 1d vector and 2d matrix</h4>
<p>
Assume we have a 3x2 matrix represented in an attribute tensor field <code>document_matrix</code>
with a tensor type <code>tensor(x[3],y[2])</code> with content:
<pre>
{ {x:0,y:0}:1.0, {x:1,y:0}:3.0, {x:2,y:0}:5.0, {x:0,y:1}:7.0, {x:1,y:1}:11.0, {x:2,y:1}:13.0 }
</pre>
Also assume we have 1x3 vector passed down with the query as a tensor
with type <code>tensor(x[3])</code> with content:
<pre>
{ {x:0}:1.0, {x:1}:3.0, {x:2}:5.0 }
</pre>
that is set as <code>query(query_vector)</code> in a searcher
as specified in <a href="reference/tensor.html#query-feature">query feature</a>.
</p><p>
To calculate the matrix product between the 1x3 vector and 3x2 matrix (to get a 1x2 vector)
use the following ranking expression:
<pre>
sum(query(query_vector) * attribute(document_matrix),x)
</pre>
This is a sparse tensor product over the shared dimension <code>x</code>,
followed by a sum over the same dimension.
</p>
