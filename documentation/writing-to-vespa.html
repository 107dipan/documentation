<p>
Vespa documents are created according to the
<a href="reference/document-json-format.html">Document JSON Format</a>
or constructed programmatically - options:
<ul><li>
  <a href="document-api.html">RESTified Document Operation API</a>:
  REST API for get, put, remove, update, visit.
</li><li>
  <a href="vespa-http-client.html">The Vespa HTTP client</a>.
  A standalone jar which feeds to Vespa either by method calls in Java or from the command line.
  It provides a simple API while achieving high performance
  by using multiplexing and multiple parallel async connections.
  It is recommended in all cases when feeding from a node outside the Vespa cluster. 
</li><li>
  <a href="document-api-guide.html">The Document API</a>.
  This provides direct read-and write access to Vespa documents using Vespa's internal communication layer.
  Use this when accessing documents from Java components in Vespa
  such as <a href="searcher-development.html">searchers</a> and
  <a href="document-processing.html">document processors</a>.
</li><li>
  <a href="reference/vespa-cmdline-tools.html#vespa-feeder">vespa-feeder</a> is a utility to feed data with high performance.
  <a href="reference/vespa-cmdline-tools.html#vespa-get">vespa-get</a> gets single documents,
  <a href="reference/vespa-cmdline-tools.html#vespa-visit">vespa-visit</a> gets multiple.
</li></ul>
Refer to <a href="performance/sizing-feeding.html">feed sizing guide</a> for feeding performance.

CRUD operations:
</p>
<table class="table">
<thead>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
  <td><strong>Put</strong></td>
  <td>
    <a href="reference/document-json-format.html#put">Put</a> is used to write a <a href="documents.html">document</a>.
    A document is a set of name-value pairs referred to as <em>fields</em>.
    The fields available for a given document is given by the document type,
    provided by the application's <a href="search-definitions.html">search definition</a> -
    see <a href="reference/search-definitions-reference.html#field">field types</a>.
    A document is overwritten if a document with the same document ID exists
    and without a <a href="reference/document-json-format.html#test-and-set">test and set</a> condition.
  </td>
</tr><tr>
  <td><strong>Remove</strong></td>
  <td>
    <a href="reference/document-json-format.html#remove">Remove</a> removes a document.
    Later requests to access the document will not find it - read
    more about <a href="elastic-vespa.html#data-retention-vs-size">remove-entries</a>.
    If the document to be removed is not found, this is returned in the reply.
    This is not considered a failure.
    Like the put and update operations, a
    <a href="reference/document-json-format.html#test-and-set">
    test and set</a> condition can be specified for remove operations,
    only removing the document when the condition is true.
  </td>
</tr><tr>
  <td><strong>Update</strong></td>
  <td>
    <a href="reference/document-json-format.html#update">Update</a>
    is also referred to as <em>partial update</em> as it updates parts of a document.
    If the document to update does not exist, the update returns a reply
    stating that no document was found.
    A <a href="reference/document-json-format.html#test-and-set">
    test and set</a> condition can be specified for updates.
    Example usage is updating only documents with given timestamps.
  </td>
</tr><tr>
  <td><strong>Get</strong></td>
  <td>
    <a href="document-api.html#get">Get</a> returns the newest document instance.
    The <em>get</em> reply includes the last-updated <a href="#timestamps">timestamp</a> of the document. <!-- ToDo check this -->
  </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>



<h2 id="feed-block">Feed block</h2>
<p>
Feed operations fail when a cluster is at disk or memory capacity.
Configure <a href="reference/services-content.html#resource-limits">resource-limits</a> to tune this -
the defaults block feeding before disk or memory is full.
</p><p>
The <a href="performance/attribute-memory-usage.html#multivalue-mapping-enum-store">attribute multivalue mapping and enum store</a>
can also go full and block feeding.
</p><p>
To remedy, add nodes to the content cluster or use nodes with higher capacity.
The data will <a href="elastic-vespa.html">auto-redistribute</a>, and feeding is unblocked.
These metrics indicate whether feeding is blocked (set to 1 when blocked):
<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <th>content.proton.resource_usage.feeding_blocked</th>
    <td>disk or memory</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <th>content.proton.documentdb.attribute.resource_usage.feeding_blocked</th>
    <td><a href="performance/attribute-memory-usage.html#multivalue-mapping-enum-store">attribute enum store</a>
      or <a href="search-definitions.html#multivalue-fields">multivalue</a></td>
  </tr>
</table>
When feeding is blocked, events are logged - examples:
<pre>
Put operation rejected for document 'id:test:test::0': 'diskLimitReached: {
  action: \"add more content nodes\",
  reason: \"disk used (0.85) &gt; disk limit (0.8)\",
  capacity: 100000000000,
  free: 85000000000,
  available: 85000000000,
  diskLimit: 0.8
}'
</pre>
</p>



<h2 id="ordering">Ordering</h2>
<p>
The Document API uses the document identifier to implement ordering.
Documents with the same identifier will have the same serialize id,
and a Document API client will ensure that only one operation with a given
serialize id is pending at the same time.
This ensures that if a client sends multiple operations for the
same document, they will be processed in a defined order.
</p><p>
<strong>Note:</strong> If sending two <em>put</em> operations to the same
document, and the first operation fails, the second operation that was
enqueued is sent. If the client chooses to just resend the failed request,
the order of operations has been switched.
</p><p>
If <em>different</em> clients have pending operations on the same document,
the order is undefined.
</p>



<h2 id="timestamps">Timestamps</h2>
<p>
Write operations like <em>put</em>, <em>update</em> and <em>remove</em>,
have a timestamp assigned, passing through the
<a href="content/content-nodes.html#distributor">distributor</a>.
The timestamp is guaranteed to be unique within the
<a href="content/buckets.html">bucket</a> where it is stored.
The timestamp is used by the content layer to decide which operation is newest.
These timestamps may be used when <a href="content/visiting.html">visiting</a>,
to only process/retrieve documents within a given timeframe.
To guarantee unique timestamps, they are in microseconds,
and the microsecond part may be generated or altered to avoid conflicts with other documents.
</p><p>
The internal timestamp is often referred to as the last modified time.
This is the time of the last write operation going through the <em>distributor</em>.
If documents are migrated from cluster to cluster,
the target cluster will have new timestamps for their entries,
and when reprocessing documents within a cluster,
documents will have new timestamps even if not modified.
</p>
