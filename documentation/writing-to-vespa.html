<p>
Vespa documents are created according to the
<a href="reference/document-json-format.html">Document JSON Format</a>
or constructed programmatically.
Options for writing Documents to Vespa:
<ul><li>
  <a href="document-api.html">RESTified Document Operation API</a>:
  Simple REST API for operations based on document ID (get, put, remove, update,visit). 
</li><li>
  <a href="vespa-http-client.html">The Vespa HTTP client</a>. This is a small standalone jar which
  feeds to Vespa either through method calls in Java or by consuming a file from the command line.
  It provides a simple API while achieving high performance by using multiplexing and multiple parallel async connections.
  It is recommended in all cases when feeding from a node outside the Vespa cluster. 
</li><li>
  <a href="document-api-guide.html">The Document API</a>. This provides direct read-and write access to Vespa documents
  through Vespa's internal communication layer. Use this when accessing documents from Java components in Vespa
  such as searchers and document processors.
</li><li>
  <a href="reference/vespa-cmdline-tools.html#vespa-feeder">vespa-feeder</a> is a utility to feed data with high performance.
  <a href="reference/vespa-cmdline-tools.html#vespa-get">vespa-get</a> gets single documents,
  <a href="content/visiting.html">vespa-visit</a> gets multiple.
</li></ul>
</p>
<p>
The CRUD operations are the four basic functions of persistent storage:
</p>
<table class="table">
<thead>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
  <td><strong>Put</strong></td>
  <td>
    <a href="reference/document-json-format.html#put">Put</a> is used to write a document to Vespa.
    A <em>document</em> is a set of name-value pairs referred to as <em>fields</em>.
    The fields available for a given document is given by the document type,
    provided by the application's <a href="search-definitions.html">search definition</a> -
    see <a href="reference/search-definitions-reference.html#field">field types</a>.
    A document is overwritten if a document with the same document ID exists
    and no <em>test-and-set</em> condition is given.
    By specifying a <a href="reference/document-json-format.html#conditional-updates-test-and-set">
    test and set condition</a>, one can perform a conditional put
    that only executes if the condition matches the already existing document.
  </td>
</tr><tr>
  <td><strong>Remove</strong></td>
  <td>
    <a href="reference/document-json-format.html#remove">Remove</a>
    removes a document from Vespa.
    Later requests to access the document will not find it - read
    more about <a href="elastic-vespa.html#data-retention-vs-size">remove-entries</a>.
    If the document to be removed is not found, this is returned in the reply.
    This is not considered a failure.
    Like the put and update operations, a
    <a href="reference/document-json-format.html#conditional-updates-test-and-set">
    test and set condition</a> can be specified for remove operations,
    only removing the document when the condition (document selection) matches the document.
  </td>
</tr><tr>
  <td><strong>Update</strong></td>
  <td>
    <a href="reference/document-json-format.html#update">Update</a>
    is also referred to as <em>partial update</em> as it updates parts of a document.
    If the document to update does not exist, the update returns a reply
    stating that no document was found.
    A <a href="reference/document-json-format.html#conditional-updates-test-and-set">
    test and set condition</a> can be specified for updates.
    Example usage is updating only documents with given timestamps.
  </td>
</tr><tr>
  <td><strong>Get</strong></td>
  <td>
    <a href="document-api.html#get">Get</a> returns the newest document instance.
    The <em>get</em> reply includes the last-updated <a href="#timestamps">timestamp</a> of the document,
    stating when the document was last written. <!-- ToDo check this -->
  </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>



<h2 id="ordering">Ordering</h2>
<p>
The Document API uses the document identifier to implement ordering.
Documents with the same identifier will have the same serialize id,
and a Document API client will ensure that only one operation with a given
serialize id is pending at the same time.
This ensures that if a client sends multiple operations for the
same document, they will be processed in a defined order.
</p><p>
<strong>Note:</strong> If sending two <em>put</em> operations to the same
document, and the first operation fails, the second operation that was
enqueued is sent. If the client chooses to just resend the failed request,
the order of operations has been switched.
</p><p>
If different clients have operations towards the same document pending,
the order of operations is undefined.
</p>


<h2 id="timestamps">Timestamps</h2>
<p>
Write operations like <em>put</em>, <em>update</em> and <em>remove</em>,
will have a timestamp assigned to them going through the <em>distributor</em>.
This timestamp is guaranteed to be unique within the
<a href="content/buckets.html">bucket</a> where it is stored.
This timestamp is used by the content layer to decide which operation is newest.
These timestamps may be used when
<a href="content/visiting.html">visiting</a>, to only process/retrieve
documents within a given timeframe.
To guarantee unique timestamps, they are given in microseconds, and the
microsecond part may be generated or altered to avoid conflicts with other
documents.
</p>


<h3 id="last-modified-time">Last modified time</h3>
<p>
The internal timestamp is often referred to as the last modified time.
This is the time of the last write operation
going through the distributor. If documents are migrated from cluster to
cluster, the target cluster will have new timestamps for their entries, and
when reprocessing documents within a cluster, documents will have new
timestamps even if not modified.
</p>



<h2 id="capacity-and-feed">Capacity and feed</h2>
<p>
Feed operations fail when a cluster is at full capacity.
The following limits will block feeding:
<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr><th>resource</th><th>default</th><th>metric</th><th>description</th></tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr><td>disk</td>
  <td><a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa/blob/master/searchcore/src/vespa/searchcore/config/proton.def">
    writefilter.disklimit</a></td>
  <td>content.proton.resource_usage.disk</td>
  <td><a href="reference/services-content.html#resource-limits">Configure</a> disk limit</td></tr>
<tr><td>memory</td>
  <td><a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa/blob/master/searchcore/src/vespa/searchcore/config/proton.def">
    writefilter.memorylimit</a></td>
  <td>content.proton.resource_usage.memory</td>
  <td><a href="reference/services-content.html#resource-limits">Configure</a> memory limit</td></tr>
<tr><td>attribute enum store</td>
  <td><a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa/blob/master/searchcore/src/vespa/searchcore/config/proton.def">
    writefilter.attribute.enumstorelimit</a>
  </td><td>content.proton.documentdb.attribute.resource_usage.enum_store</td>
  <td>For string attribute fields or attribute fields with
    <a href="attributes.html#attributes-and-search">fast-search</a>,
    there is a max limit on the size of the unique values stored for that attribute.
    The component storing these values is called enum store. The limit is 32GB</td></tr>
<tr><td>attribute multi-value</td>
  <td><a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa/blob/master/searchcore/src/vespa/searchcore/config/proton.def">
    writefilter.attribute.multivaluelimit</a>
  </td><td>content.proton.documentdb.attribute.resource_usage.multi_value</td>
  <td>For array or weighted set attribute fields,
    there is a max limit on the number of documents that can have the same number of values.
    The limit is 128M (2^27) documents.
    To remedy, either change the attribute field to use
    <a href="reference/search-definitions-reference.html#attribute">huge</a>, or add/change nodes</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
To remedy, add nodes to the content cluster or swap nodes with higher capacity.
The data will <a href="elastic-vespa.html">auto-redistribute</a> and feeding will succeed again.
These metrics indicate whether feeding is blocked (set to 1 when blocked):
<ul>
  <li><em>content.proton.resource_usage.feeding_blocked</em>: disk / memory</li>
  <li><em>content.proton.documentdb.attribute.resource_usage.feeding_blocked</em>: attribute enum store or multi-value</li>
</ul>
When feeding is blocked, events are logged - examples:
<pre>
Put operation rejected for document 'id:test:test::0': 'diskLimitReached: {
  action: \"add more content nodes\",
  reason: \"disk used (0.85) &gt; disk limit (0.8)\",
  capacity: 100000000000,
  free: 85000000000,
  available: 85000000000,
  diskLimit: 0.8
}'
</pre>
</p>


<!-- ToDo: Fix the below later, migrated from partial-update.html - rewrite / move this elsewhere -->


<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>
<p>
To improve feed throughput, increase
<a href="reference/services-content.html#visibility-delay">visibility-delay</a>
to batch writes on the content nodes for higher write performance.
This trades off latency -
writes will take effect in search results after <em>visibility-delay</em> seconds.
This is particularly useful when batch feeding, like initial bootstrap or grid jobs.
</p><p>
Speed of partial updates and garbage collection is reduced if
<a href="reference/services-content.html#searchable-copies">
searchable copies</a> is lower than <a href="reference/services-content.html#redundancy">redundancy</a>.
This is caused by no <a href="attributes.html">attributes</a> for the non-searchable copies.
Set <a href="reference/search-definitions-reference.html#attribute">fast-access</a> on the attributes to
update to ensure they exist for the non-searchable copies as well.
