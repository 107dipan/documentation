<p>
Vespa documents are created according to the
<a href="reference/document-json-format.html">Document JSON Format</a>
or constructed programmatically - options:
<ul><li>
  <a href="document-api.html">RESTified Document Operation API</a>:
  Simple REST API for operations based on document ID (get, put, remove, update,visit). 
</li><li>
  <a href="vespa-http-client.html">The Vespa HTTP client</a>. This is a small standalone jar which
  feeds to Vespa either through method calls in Java or by consuming a file from the command line.
  It provides a simple API while achieving high performance by using multiplexing and multiple parallel async connections.
  It is recommended in all cases when feeding from a node outside the Vespa cluster. 
</li><li>
  <a href="document-api-guide.html">The Document API</a>. This provides direct read-and write access to Vespa documents
  through Vespa's internal communication layer. Use this when accessing documents from Java components in Vespa
  such as searchers and document processors.
</li><li>
  <a href="reference/vespa-cmdline-tools.html#vespa-feeder">vespa-feeder</a> is a utility to feed data with high performance.
  <a href="reference/vespa-cmdline-tools.html#vespa-get">vespa-get</a> gets single documents,
  <a href="reference/vespa-cmdline-tools.html#vespa-visit">vespa-visit</a> gets multiple.
</li></ul>

CRUD operations:
</p>
<table class="table">
<thead>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
  <td><strong>Put</strong></td>
  <td>
    <a href="reference/document-json-format.html#put">Put</a> is used to write a <a href="documents.html">document</a>.
    A document is a set of name-value pairs referred to as <em>fields</em>.
    The fields available for a given document is given by the document type,
    provided by the application's <a href="search-definitions.html">search definition</a> -
    see <a href="reference/search-definitions-reference.html#field">field types</a>.
    A document is overwritten if a document with the same document ID exists
    and no <a href="reference/document-json-format.html#test-and-set"> test and set</a> condition is given.
  </td>
</tr><tr>
  <td><strong>Remove</strong></td>
  <td>
    <a href="reference/document-json-format.html#remove">Remove</a> removes a document.
    Later requests to access the document will not find it - read
    more about <a href="elastic-vespa.html#data-retention-vs-size">remove-entries</a>.
    If the document to be removed is not found, this is returned in the reply.
    This is not considered a failure.
    Like the put and update operations, a
    <a href="reference/document-json-format.html#test-and-set">
    test and set</a> condition can be specified for remove operations,
    only removing the document when the condition (document selection) matches the document.
  </td>
</tr><tr>
  <td><strong>Update</strong></td>
  <td>
    <a href="reference/document-json-format.html#update">Update</a>
    is also referred to as <em>partial update</em> as it updates parts of a document.
    If the document to update does not exist, the update returns a reply
    stating that no document was found.
    A <a href="reference/document-json-format.html#test-and-set">
    test and set</a> condition can be specified for updates.
    Example usage is updating only documents with given timestamps.
  </td>
</tr><tr>
  <td><strong>Get</strong></td>
  <td>
    <a href="document-api.html#get">Get</a> returns the newest document instance.
    The <em>get</em> reply includes the last-updated <a href="#timestamps">timestamp</a> of the document. <!-- ToDo check this -->
  </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>



<h2 id="ordering">Ordering</h2>
<p>
The Document API uses the document identifier to implement ordering.
Documents with the same identifier will have the same serialize id,
and a Document API client will ensure that only one operation with a given
serialize id is pending at the same time.
This ensures that if a client sends multiple operations for the
same document, they will be processed in a defined order.
</p><p>
<strong>Note:</strong> If sending two <em>put</em> operations to the same
document, and the first operation fails, the second operation that was
enqueued is sent. If the client chooses to just resend the failed request,
the order of operations has been switched.
</p><p>
If different clients have operations towards the same document pending,
the order of operations is undefined.
</p>


<h2 id="timestamps">Timestamps</h2>
<p>
Write operations like <em>put</em>, <em>update</em> and <em>remove</em>,
will have a timestamp assigned to them going through the <em>distributor</em>.
This timestamp is guaranteed to be unique within the
<a href="content/buckets.html">bucket</a> where it is stored.
This timestamp is used by the content layer to decide which operation is newest.
These timestamps may be used when <a href="content/visiting.html">visiting</a>,
to only process/retrieve documents within a given timeframe.
To guarantee unique timestamps, they are given in microseconds,
and the microsecond part may be generated or altered to avoid conflicts with other documents.
</p><p>
The internal timestamp is often referred to as the last modified time.
This is the time of the last write operation going through the <a href="distributor.html">distributor</a>.
If documents are migrated from cluster to cluster,
the target cluster will have new timestamps for their entries,
and when reprocessing documents within a cluster,
documents will have new timestamps even if not modified.
</p>



<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>
<p>
When updating the data (put/update/remove), consider:
<ul>
  <li><a href="proton.html#transaction-log">transaction log</a></li>
  <li><a href="document-summaries.html#document-store">document store</a></li>
  <li><a href="attributes.html">attributes</a></li>
  <li><a href="proton.html#index">indexes</a></li>
</ul>
These data structures might or might not be updated depending on the <a href="search-definitions.html">search definition</a>.
The transaction log is always written.
</p><p>
<em>Putting</em> a document will always update the document store, a file append.
</p><p>
A partial update on an <em>indexed</em> field will read the document from the document store,
change the field, and write it back to the store - and also update the memory index.
</p><p>
A partial update on an <em>attribute</em> field is a memory-only operation (except for the transaction log).
There are some performance tradeoffs described in <a href="attributes.html">attribute update</a>:
Speed of partial updates and garbage collection is reduced if
<a href="reference/services-content.html#searchable-copies">
searchable copies</a> is lower than <a href="reference/services-content.html#redundancy">redundancy</a>.
This is caused by no <a href="attributes.html">attributes</a> for the non-searchable copies.
Set <a href="reference/search-definitions-reference.html#attribute">fast-access</a> on the attributes to
update to ensure they exist for the non-searchable copies as well.
</p><p>
To improve feed throughput, trading off freshness, increase
<a href="reference/services-content.html#visibility-delay">visibility-delay</a>
to batch writes on the content nodes for higher write performance.
This trades off latency -
writes will take effect in search results after <em>visibility-delay</em> seconds.
This is particularly useful when batch feeding, like initial bootstrap or grid jobs.
</p><p>
Configure the fraction of CPU capacity to allocate to feeding in
<a href="content/setup-proton-tuning.html#feeding">concurrency</a>.
</p><p>
The feeding endpoint is run in a <a href="overview.html">stateless container cluster</a>.
Documents flow from this cluster to the content node cluster.
Hence both this cluster and the content node cluster must be evaluated to find the bottleneck.
For the stateless cluster, check CPU usage and GC metrics -
the <a href="performance/container-tuning.html">heap</a> must not be too low.
</p>



<h2 id="feed-block">Feed block</h2>
<p>
Feed operations fail when a cluster is at full disk or memory capacity.
Configure <a href="reference/services-content.html#resource-limits">resource-limits</a> to tune this -
the defaults will block feeding before disk or memory is full.
</p><p>
The <a href="performance/attribute-memory-usage.html#multivalue-mapping-enum-store">attribute multivalue mapping and enum store</a>
can also go full and block feeding.
</p><p>
To remedy, add nodes to the content cluster or swap nodes with higher capacity.
The data will <a href="elastic-vespa.html">auto-redistribute</a> and feeding will succeed again.
These metrics indicate whether feeding is blocked (set to 1 when blocked):
<ul>
  <li><em>content.proton.resource_usage.feeding_blocked</em>: disk / memory</li>
  <li><em>content.proton.documentdb.attribute.resource_usage.feeding_blocked</em>: attribute enum store or
    <a href="search-definitions.html#multivalue-fields">multivalue</a></li>
</ul>
When feeding is blocked, events are logged - examples:
<pre>
Put operation rejected for document 'id:test:test::0': 'diskLimitReached: {
  action: \"add more content nodes\",
  reason: \"disk used (0.85) &gt; disk limit (0.8)\",
  capacity: 100000000000,
  free: 85000000000,
  available: 85000000000,
  diskLimit: 0.8
}'
</pre>
</p>
