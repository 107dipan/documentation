<p>
The <em>Document Processing Framework</em> is the home for all global
processing of Vespa input data (represented as Documents).
It runs in the JDisc Container,
and provides a development and hosting environment for processing <em>components</em>,
and a model for composing such components developed by multiple development teams
into a functional whole.
</p><p>
This document describes how to develop and deploy Document Processor components.
For an introduction to the docproc framework,
see <a href="document-processing-overview.html">Document Processing Design Goals and Features</a>.
To get started with development with the container,
see <a href="jdisc/developing-applications.html">Container developing</a>.
For reference, see the
<a href="http://javadoc.io/doc/com.yahoo.vespa/docproc">Document Processing Javadoc</a>,
and <a href="reference/services-docproc.html">services.xml syntax reference</a>.

<h2 id="document-processors">Document Processors</h2>
<p>
The components of the docproc container are called <em>document
processors</em>. A document processor is a component (usually deployed
as part of an OSGi bundle) which extends the
class <code>com.yahoo.docproc.DocumentProcessor</code>. All document
processors must implement a single method:
<pre>
public Progress process(Processing processing);
</pre>
When the container receives a document operation, it will create a
new <code>Processing</code>, and add
the <code>DocumentPut</code>s, <code>DocumentUpdate</code>s
or <code>DocumentRemove</code>s to the <code>List</code> accessible
through <code>Processing.getDocumentOperations()</code>. Furthermore, the
call stack of the document processing chain in question will
be <em>copied</em> to <code>Processing.callStack()</code>, so that
document processors may freely modify the flow of control for this
processing without affecting all other processings going on. After
creation, the <code>Processing</code> is added to an internal queue.
</p><p>
A worker thread will retrieve a <code>Processing</code> from the input
queue, and run its document operations through its call stack. A
minimal, no-op document processor implementation is thus:
</p>
<pre>
import com.yahoo.docproc.*;

public class SimpleDocumentProcessor extends DocumentProcessor {
    public Progress process(Processing processing) {
        return Progress.DONE;
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
Clearly, the <code>process()</code> method should loop through all
document operations in <code>Processing.getDocumentOperations()</code>, do
whatever it sees fit to them, and return a Progress. It is acceptable
for a document processor to throw an exception out
of <code>process()</code>.
<pre>
public Progress process(Processing processing) {
    for (DocumentOperation op : processing.getDocumentOperations()) {
        if (op instanceof DocumentPut) {
            DocumentPut put = (DocumentPut) op;
            // TODO do something to 'put here
        } else if (op instanceof DocumentUpdate) {
            DocumentUpdate update = (DocumentUpdate) op;
            // TODO do something to 'update' here
        } else if (op instanceof DocumentRemove) {
            DocumentRemove remove = (DocumentRemove) op;
            // TODO do something to 'remove' here
        }
    }
    return Progress.DONE;
}
</pre>
Possible outcomes of the <code>process()</code> method:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Progress.DONE</dt>
<dd>Returned if a document processor has successfully processed a
    <code>Processing</code>.</dd>
<dt>Progress.FAILED</dt>
<dd>Processing failed and the input message should return
    a <em>fatal</em> failure back to the feeding application, meaning
    that this application will not try to re-feed this document
    operation again.</dd>
<dt>Progress.LATER</dt>
<dd>The document processor wants to release the calling thread and be
    called again later. This is useful if e.g. calling an external
    service with high latency. The document processor may then save
    its state in the <code>Processing</code> and resume when called
    again later. There are no guarantees as to
    <em>when</em> the processor is called again with
    this <code>Processing</code>; it is simply appended to the back of
    the input queue.</dd>
<dt>Throwing a <code>com.yahoo.docproc.TransientFailureException</code></dt>
<dd>Processing failed and the input message should return
    a <em>transient</em> failure back to the feeding application,
    meaning that this application <em>may</em> try to re-feed this
    document operation again.</dd>
<dt>Throwing any other <code>RuntimeException</code></dt>
<dd>Same behavior as for <code>Progress.FAILED</code>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
By the use of <code>Progress.LATER</code>, this is an asynchronous model, where the
processing of a document operation does not need to consume one thread
for its entire lifespan. Note, however, that the document processors
themselves are shared between all processing operations in a chain,
and must thus be implemented in
a <a href="#state-in-document-processors">thread-safe way</a>.
</p><p>
Return an error message/reason by calling <code>withReason()</code>.
<pre>
if (op instanceof DocumentPut) {
    return Progress.FAILED.withReason("PUT is not supported");
}
</pre>
</p>



<h2 id="processing-context-variables">Processing Context Variables</h2>
<p>
The <code>Processing</code> has a map <code>String -&gt; Object</code>
that can be used to pass information between document processors. It
is also very useful when using <code>Progress.LATER</code>, as
discussed above, to save the state of a processing.
<pre>
/** Returns a context variable, or null if it is not set */
public Object getVariable(String name);

/** Returns an iterator of all context variables that are set */
public Iterator&lt;Map.Entry&lt;String, Object&gt;&gt; getVariableAndNameIterator();

/** Clears all context variables that have been set */
public void clearVariables();

/** Sets a context variable. */
public void setVariable(String name, Object value);

/** Removes a context variable. */
public Object removeVariable(String name);

/** Returns true if this variable is present, even if it is null */
public boolean hasVariable(String name);
</pre>
</p>



<h2 id="document-processor-chains">Document Processor Chains</h2>
<p>
The call stack mentioned above is another name for a <em>document
processor chain</em>. Document processor chains are a special case of
the general <a href="chained-components.html">component chains</a> -
to avoid confusion some concepts are explained here as well.
A document processor chain is nothing more than a list of document
processor instances, having an id, and represented as a stack. The
document processor chains are typically not created for every
processing, but are part of the configuration.  Multiple ones may
exist at the same time, the chain to execute will be specified by the
message bus destination of the incoming message. The same document
processor instance may exist in multiple document processor chains,
which is why the <code>CallStack</code> of the <code>Processing</code>
is responsible for knowing the next document processor to invoke in a
particular message.
</p><p>
The execution order of the document processors in a chain are not ordered explicitly,
but by <a href="chained-components.html#ordering-components">ordering
constraints</a> declared in the document processors or their configuration.
</p>



<h2 id="writing-a-document-processor">Writing a Document Processor</h2>
<p>
Refer to<a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/tree/master/basic-search-java">
Basic Search Java</a> to get started writing Vespa plugins from an
<a href="cloudconfig/application-packages.html">application package</a>.
This is an example of a complete document processor:
<pre>
package com.yahoo.vespatest;

import com.yahoo.docproc.DocumentProcessor;
import com.yahoo.docproc.Processing;
import com.yahoo.document.Document;
import com.yahoo.document.DocumentPut;
import com.yahoo.document.DocumentOperation;
import com.yahoo.document.datatypes.StringFieldValue;

public class Rot13DocumentProcessor extends DocumentProcessor {
    private static final String FIELD_NAME = "title";

    @Override
    public Progress process(Processing processing) {
        for (DocumentOperation op : processing.getDocumentOperations()) {
            if (op instanceof DocumentPut) {
                DocumentPut put = (DocumentPut) op;
                Document document = put.getDocument();

                StringFieldValue oldTitle = (StringFieldValue) document.getFieldValue(FIELD_NAME);
                if (oldTitle != null) {
                    document.setFieldValue(FIELD_NAME, rot13(oldTitle.getString()));
                }
            }
        }
        return Progress.DONE;
    }

    private static String rot13(String s) {
        StringBuilder output = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; s.length(); i++) {
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            if (c &gt;= 'a' && c &lt;= 'm' || c &gt;= 'A' && c &lt;= 'M') {
                c += 13;
            } else if (c &gt;= 'n' && c &lt;= 'z' || c &gt;= 'N' && c &lt;= 'Z') {
                c -= 13;
            }
            output.append(c);
        }
        return output.toString();
    }
}
</pre>
This will compile if the container-dev.jar is in the class path -
the <a href="bundle-plugin.html">bundle plugin</a> automates this.
In production, the container will create one or more
instances of this class and place it in the desired document processor
chain(s) to process document operations, as specified
in <a href="#deploying-a-document-processor">the configuration</a>.
The container will create a new instance of this
document processor only when it is reconfigured, so any data needed by
the document processor can be read and prepared from a constructor.
Constructors accept <a href="jdisc/container-components.html">configuration</a>,
as any other pluggable component.

<a href="http://javadoc.io/doc/com.yahoo.vespa/docproc">Document Processing Javadoc</a>.

<h2 id="testing-a-document-processor">Testing a Document Processor</h2>
<p>
A document processor is tested running inside a container using <em>Application</em>:
<pre>
package com.yahoo.vespatest;

import com.yahoo.application.ApplicationBuilder;
import com.yahoo.application.Networking;
import com.yahoo.application.container.DocumentProcessing;
import com.yahoo.application.container.JDisc;
import com.yahoo.component.ComponentId;
import com.yahoo.component.ComponentSpecification;
import com.yahoo.docproc.DocumentProcessor;
import com.yahoo.document.Document;
import com.yahoo.document.DocumentType;
import com.yahoo.processing.execution.chain.ChainRegistry;
import org.junit.Test;

import java.io.IOException;

import static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.equalTo;
import static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.sameInstance;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertThat;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertTrue;

public class Rot13DocprocTest {

    @Test
    public void requireThatBasicDocumentProcessingWorksForDoc() throws IOException {
        JDisc container = new ApplicationBuilder()
                .servicesXml("&lt;container version=\"1.0\"&gt;\n" +
                             "  &lt;document-processing&gt;\n" +
                             "    &lt;chain id=\"myChain\"&gt;\n" +
                             "      &lt;documentprocessor id=\"" +
                             Rot13DocumentProcessor.class.getCanonicalName() + "\"/&gt;\n" +
                             "    &lt;/chain&gt;\n" +
                             "  &lt;/document-processing&gt;\n" +
                             "&lt;/container&gt;\n")
                .documentType("music",
                              "document music {\n" +
                              "  field title type string { }\n" +
                              "}\n")
                .networking(Networking.disable)
                .build()
                .getJDisc("jdisc");

        DocumentProcessing docProc = container.documentProcessing();
        DocumentType type = docProc.getDocumentTypes().get("music");

        ChainRegistry&lt;DocumentProcessor&gt; chains = docProc.getChains();
        assertTrue(chains.allComponentsById().containsKey(new ComponentId("myChain")));

        Document doc = new Document(type, "id:test:music::this:is:a:great:album");
        doc.setFieldValue("title", "Great Album!");
        com.yahoo.docproc.Processing processing;
        DocumentProcessor.Progress progress;

        processing = new com.yahoo.docproc.Processing(doc);
        progress = docProc.process(ComponentSpecification.fromString("myChain"), processing);
        assertThat(progress, sameInstance(DocumentProcessor.Progress.DONE));
        assertThat(doc.getFieldValue("title").toString(), equalTo("Terng Nyohz!"));

        container.close();
    }
}
</pre>
</p>



<h2 id="deploying-a-document-processor">Deploying a Document Processor</h2>
<p>
Once the document processor passes unit tests, it can be deployed to
the Vespa system which will host it. The document processor must be
packaged as a bundle and added to the Vespa application package, which
is then deployed. How to create a bundle is described
in <a href="jdisc/developing-osgi-bundles.html">Building OSGi bundles</a>.
To include the document processor in <a href="reference/services-docproc.html">services.xml</a>,
define a document processing chain (here named <em>default</em>) and add document processor to it:
<!-- ToDo: why call it default? routing goes to the default chain -->
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;services version="1.0"&gt;
  &lt;admin version="2.0"&gt;
    &lt;adminserver hostalias="node1" /&gt;
  &lt;/admin&gt;
  &lt;container version="1.0" id="default"&gt;
    &lt;nodes&gt;
      &lt;node hostalias="node1"/&gt;
    &lt;/nodes&gt;
<span style="background-color: yellow;">    &lt;document-processing&gt;
      &lt;chain id="default"&gt;
        &lt;documentprocessor id="com.yahoo.vespatest.Rot13DocumentProcessor"/&gt;
      &lt;/chain&gt;
    &lt;/document-processing&gt;</span>
  &lt;/container&gt;
&lt;/services&gt;
</pre>
The document processor id above is resolved to the component bundle
jar we added by the symbolic name in the manifest, and to the right
class within the bundle by the class name. By keeping all these three
the same, we keep things simple, but more advanced use where this is
possible is also supported. This will be explained in later sections.
</p><p>
By creating a directory containing
<a href="reference/services.html">services.xml</a>,
<a href="reference/hosts.html">hosts.xml</a>
and <em>components/rot13docproc.jar</em>,
that directory becomes a complete application package containing a bundle.
<a href="cloudconfig/application-packages.html#deploy">Deploy</a>
this to a Vespa instance.
</p>



<h2 id="document-processing-execution-model">Document Processing Execution Model</h2>
<p>
The Document Processing Framework works like this:
<ol>
<li>A thread from the message bus layer appends an incoming message to
    an internal priority queue, shared between all document processing
    chains configured on a node. The priority is set based on the
    message bus priority of the message. Messages of the same priority
    are ordered FIFO.</li>
<li>One worker thread from the docproc thread pool picks one message
    from the head of the queue, deserializes it, copies the call stack
    (chain) in question, and runs it through the document processors.</li>
<li>Processing finishes if <strong>(a)</strong> the document(s) has
    passed successfully through the whole chain,
    or <strong>(b)</strong> a document processor in the chain has
    returned Progress.FAILED or thrown an exception.</li>
<li>The same thread passes the message on to the message bus layer for
    further transport on to its destination.</li>
</ol>
There is a single instance of each document processor chain. In every
chain, there is a single instance of each document processor.  (Unless
a chain is configured with multiple, identical document processors
- this is a rare case.)
</p><p>
As is evident from the model above, multiple worker threads execute
the document processors in a chain concurrently. Thus; many threads of
execution can be going through the <code>process()</code> method of a
document processor, at the same time.
</p><p>
This model places a very important constraint on document processor classes:
<em>instance variables are not safe.</em> They must be eliminated, or
made threadsafe somehow.
</p>



<h2 id="state-in-document-processors">State in Document Processors</h2>
<p>
Any state in the document processor for the particular Processing
should be kept as local variables in the process method,
while state which should be shared by all Processings should
be kept as member variables. As the latter kind will be accessed by
multiple threads at any one time, the state of such member variables
must be <em>threadsafe</em>.
This critical restriction is similar to those of e.g. the Servlet API.
Options for implementing a multithread-safe document processor with instance variables:
<ol>
<li>Use immutable (and preferably final) objects: they never change
    after they are constructed; no modifications to their state occurs
    after the DocumentProcessor constructor returns.</li>
<li>Use a single instance of a thread-safe class.</li>
<li>Create a single instance and synchronize access to it across all
    threads (but this will severely limit your scalability).</li>
<li>Arrange for each thread to have its own instance, e.g. with
    a <code>ThreadLocal</code>.</li>
</ol>
</p>



<h2 id="asynchronous-execution">Asynchronous Execution</h2>
<p>
The execution model outlined above also shows one important
restriction: If a document processor performs any high-latency
operation in its process() method, a docproc worker thread will be
occupied. With all <em>n</em> worker threads blocking on an external
resource, throughput will be severely limited. This can be alleviated
by saving the state in the Processing object, and returning
<code>Progress.LATER</code>.
A document processor doing a high-latency operation should use a pattern like this:
<ol>
<li>Check a self-defined context variable in Processing for
    status. Basically, <em>have we seen this Processing before?</em></li>
<li>If no:
    <ol>
    <li>We have been given a Processing object fresh off the network,
        we have not seen this before. Process it up until the
        high-latency operation.</li>
    <li>Start the high-latency operation (possibly in a separate
        thread).</li>
    <li>Save the state of the operation in a self-defined context
        variable in the Processing.</li>
    <li>Return Progress.LATER. This Processing is the appended to the
        back of the input queue, and we will be called again
        later.</li>
    </ol></li>
<li>If yes:
   <ol>
   <li>Retrieve the reference that we set in our self-defined context
       variable in Processing.</li>
   <li>Is the high-latency operation done? If so, return Progress.DONE.</li>
   <li>Is it not yet done? Return Progress.LATER again.</li>
   </ol></li>
</ol>
As is evident, this will let the finite set of document processing
threads to perform more work at the same time.
</p>



<h2 id="reconfiguring-document-processing">Reconfiguring Document Processing</h2>
<p>
Consider the following configuration:
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
&lt;services version="1.0"&gt;
  &lt;container version="1.0" id="default"&gt;
    &lt;document-processing&gt;
      &lt;chain id="default"&gt;
        &lt;documentprocessor id="SomeDocumentProcessor"&gt;
          &lt;config name="foo.something"&gt;
            &lt;variable&gt;value&lt;/variable&gt;
          &lt;/config&gt;
        &lt;/documentprocessor&gt
      &lt;/chain&gt;
    &lt;/document-processing&gt;
  &lt;/container&gt;
&lt;/services&gt;
</pre>
Changing chain ids, components in a chain, component configuration,
and schema mapping all takes effect after
<a href="cloudconfig/application-packages.html#deploy">vespa-deploy activate</a> -
no restart required. Changing <em>cluster names</em> (i.e. the jdisc id)
requires a restart of docproc services after <em>vespa-deploy activate</em>.
</p>
