<p>
Documents can be uniformly distributed or in groups.
Read <a href="../elastic-vespa.html">elastic Vespa</a> before this article.
</p>



<h2 id="grouped-documents">Grouped documents</h2>
<p>
The <a href="../reference/services-content.html#group">group</a> element is used to distribute
documents - use cases:
<table class="table">
<thead></thead><tbody>
<tr>
  <th>Cluster upgrade</th>
  <td>Use two (or more) groups with one replica each -
  then shut down one group in the cluster for upgrade.
  This is quicker than doing it one by one node - the tradeoff
  is that 50% of the nodes must sustain the full load (in case of two groups),
  and one must always grow the cluster by two (or more) nodes,
  one in each group. Latency per search node goes up with a larger index,
  such grouping will double the index size.</td>
</tr><tr>
  <th>Query throughput</th>
  <td>Applications with high query load on a small index
  can benefit of keeping the full index on all nodes - i.e. configuring
  the same number of groups as nodes. This confines queries to one node only,
  so less <em>total</em> work is done per query in the cluster.
  Hence the throughput increase. This increases latency
  compared with splitting the index on many nodes. It also limits
  options when growing the index size - at some point, the query latency might
  grow too high, and the only option then is to add nodes to the group.
  Having two nodes per group is bad if one node goes down, as one node must
  hence be able to hold the full index again. Use this option with care.</td>
</tr>

<h2>Details</h2>
<p>
By default, Vespa distributes <a href="buckets.html">buckets</a> uniformly
across all distributor and storage nodes.
This creates a uniform distribution, but has a few drawbacks:
<ul>
<li>If the cluster is large, some nodes often have less network bandwidth
between them than nodes that are closer to each other. Spreading the copies at
random, we might not get to utilize this improved bandwidth between nodes that
are closer to each other at all.</li>
<li>Wanting copies of data to be available at all times, storing few copies,
means that you can do maintenance on very few nodes at a time to keep data
available. For instance, if you store only 2 copies, you can only do
maintenance on one node at a time to ensure all data has at least one copy
available, which makes upgrades time consuming.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Hierarchical distribution can remedy the above. With this,
you have control over where bucket copies are stored in
relation to each other. For instance, if your cluster consists of 10 racks, you
can define that for any given bucket, it should store 2 copies in one rack and
2 copies in another rack. That means that you can take down a whole rack, and
you are still sure that all your data is available, because you know all data
on that rack should have 2 copies on another rack. Also, improved network
bandwidth can be utilized. If a node has restarted and it needs to fetch some
data that came in while restarting to get up to date, it can now choose to
fetch that data from a node on the same rack, which has better connectivity as
it is in the same rack. (Here you must of course define one group per rack, and
add the nodes in the rack in the respective groups)
</p><p>
This can also be used for simple data center failover. If nodes are divided into two
separate geographical locations, you can define a group for each of these
locations, and you can for instance configure 2 copies to be stored on each
location. That way, your data is always available on both locations, and you
can survive a fire without data loss.
</p><p>
Currently, you have no control of what group is selected for which copies
though. The failover example works because you divide your copies among N groups
with equal amount of copies in each, and you only have N groups available, thus
you  know each group will have that amount of copies.
</p><p>
Groups can be defined in several layers, creating a tree-structure. That way
you can for instance define a top level group to do failover, and below that you can
make smaller groups to improve network bandwidth locally and ensure you can
take down multiple nodes simultaneously without making any data unavailable.
</p><p>
When configuring the groups, you have to bundle either a set of storage
nodes (for a bottom level group) or a set of groups at a lower level to make
your group. Then you must specify how data is to be distributed among the
group children. Refer to the
<a href="../reference/services-content.html#group">group</a>
documentation for details about how to configure storage groups.
</p>


<h3 id="downside">Skew in data distribution when using groups</h3>
<p>
Which groups are selected as primary, secondary and so on, groups for a
given bucket is randomly determined using the same ideal state algorithm we
use to pick nodes, described in more detail in the
<a href="idealstate.html">ideal state</a> reference document. Each group is
assigned an index, to be used in this algorithm. Because each bucket will
have different sets of groups assigned to it, all data should still be
equally divided among nodes, even though you have defined that one rack
should keep twice as many bucket copies as another rack. If you have two
racks, then one will typically store 2 copies for half of the buckets, and
the other will store 2 copies of the other half of the buckets.
</p><p>
This will however likely create a bit worse skew globally compared to not
using groups. If you're to divide buckets between two groups, you will
likely get a little skew. Say one group will store 50.05 % of your data
because the ideal state algorithm use pseudo-random numbers and doesn't
create perfect distributions. Then the next level might also have a little
skew, and as we move down, the cumulative skew will rise a bit.

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<p>
Here are some examples illustrating how the data placement control feature
would be helpful. They all depict a deployment scenario with
<a href="../elastic-vespa.html#redundancy">redundancy</a> 3 (i.e.
3 data copies) and a cluster topology composed of 2 clusters with 2 racks of
nodes each. These examples have few groups and nodes to keep the example
simple.  In a normal case you'd probably have more racks than you want to store
copies in for instance, so you'd pick 2 of N racks rather than 2 of 2.
</p>


<h3>Cautious data placement</h3>
<p>
A way to reduce the risk of data unavailability, is to spread the data copies
across different geographical locations (e.g. data centers). In this example, the aim
is to place all the copies in different racks (cautiousness).
</p><p>

</p><p>
Furthermore, this data placement enables fast upgrade procedures without service
interruption, as entire groups can be upgraded at a time.
</p>


<h3>Data placement for performance</h3>
<p>
Large deployments involving dozens or hundreds of nodes intrinsically imply
heterogeneous connectivity between groups of nodes. For instance, nodes located
on the same switch will experience a greater connectivity than nodes that are
not. And so it is at the rack, cluster and data center levels.
</p><p>
It is possible to reduce cross-level communication patterns by placing data
replicas close to each other. In this example, the aim is to place all the
copies in the same rack (optimized for performance).

</p>


<h3>Hybrid data placement</h3>
<p>
Hybrid data placement trade performance and cautiousness to get a bit of both worlds.
In this example, the aim is to place two copies in the same rack, and
the third copy in a different rack but still in the same cluster.
</p><p>
<img src="../img/storage/hierarch-data-distr-ex1.png" width=700 height=325/>
</p><p>
If additional cautiousness is desired, the third copy can be placed in the other cluster.
