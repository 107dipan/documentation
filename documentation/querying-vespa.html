<p>
This is an overview of the components and data flow for Vespa queries.
</p><p>
Queries are sent to Vespa using the <a href="search-api.html">Search API</a>.
Query strings are written in <a href="query-language.html">YQL</a>.
</p>


<h2 id="query-flow">Query flow</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    A query is sent from a front-end application to a Query Result Server node - QRS.
    The QRS is implemented using the <a href="jdisc/index.html">Vespa container</a>.
  </li><li>
    Query processing, like stemming and geo-tagging, is done in <em>search chains</em> in the QRS.
    <!-- ToDo should link to a doc with search chains here -->
  </li><li>
    The query is sent from the QRS to all content clusters in the system -
    see <a href="federation.html">federation</a>.
    Content clusters have top-level <a href="#dispatch">dispatchers</a> (TLDs),
    which dispatches queries to <a href="proton.html">proton</a> search nodes.
    For better caching, queries have affinity to TLDs.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>

</p><p>
At this point the query enters one or more <a href="reference/services-content.html">content clusters</a>:
</p>
<ol>

      <li>
        The query arrives at each content node's mid-level dispatcher (MLD - binary is the same as for TLD).
        An exception to this is <a href="content/data-placement.html">grouped clusters</a>,
        in this case a subset of content nodes are queried.
        MLD forwards the query to vespa-proton.
      </li><li>
        vespa-proton searches its index and returns its results  to the MLD.
      </li><li>
    When all MLDs have responded to the TLD,
    it merges their partial results and responds to the QRS.
  </li><li>
    The QRS performs processing of the results in search chains,
    requerying data if needed, before it  returns these to the querying entity.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="dispatch">Dispatch</h2>
<p>
The vespa-dispatch service's primary task is to dispatch queries
such that it covers the entire document base,
with the lowest possible maximum load on its relevant search nodes.
The TLD knows what queries are being processed and at which nodes,
and load balancing is done by dispatching to the node (MLD) with the lowest number of running queries.
</p>


<h3 id="tld-and-mld">TLD and MLD</h3>
<p>
The two dispatch modes are separable in the log files by their entry;
the MLD writes:
<pre>
(...) searchnode.dispatch0.dispatch
vespa-dispatch (...)
</pre>
whereas the TLD writes:
<pre>
(...)
topleveldispatch vespa-dispatch (...)
</pre>
</p>
