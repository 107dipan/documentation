<h2>Viewing the log</h2>

<p>To view the system log, use the <code>vespa-logfmt</code> utility. This formats and filters the raw log.
The log on admin server(s) includes log lines from all the Vespa nodes in your system.</p>

<p>For example

  <pre class="code">/opt/vespa/bin/vespa-logfmt -l warning,error</pre>

displays all errors and warnings.</p>

<p>If you run Docker you need to go inside the Docker container to run this, so do

  <pre class="code">docker exec -it [container-name] bash</pre>
  
first.</p>


<h2>Feeding or querying does not respond</h2>

<p>If you encounter something like

  <pre>INFO: Problem with Handshake localhost:8080 ssl=false: localhost:8080 failed to respond</pre>

when feeding, or <code>No data</code> when querying, it usually means the node is set up with isufficient memory + swap
and is too busy swapping data to get anything done. If you are running <b>Docker</b> on your laptop, you need to
increase memory for the container under Preferences - Advanced.</p>
