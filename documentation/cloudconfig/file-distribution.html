<p>
An <a href="../reference/application-packages-reference.html">application package</a>
has possibly components and other large files to be distributed to the Vespa nodes.
The <em>file-distribution</em> service distributes these files to the nodes
at <em>vespa-deploy activate</em>.

<strong>This document is work in progress</strong>
</p>



<h2>Files</h2>
<p>
which files are distributed?
<ul>
  <li>components</li>
  <li>rules</li>
  <li>all files in app package not in searchdefinitions, search, ext</li>
  <li><a href="../reference/search-definitions-reference.html#constant">constant tensors</a></li>
</ul>
Reference to file made by hashing content and write the reference/content to
<em>$VESPA_HOME/var/db/vespa/filedistribution</em>
</p><p>
when new components are distributed, the container gets a new ref, waits for it to be available
(some details here on the workings)
</p><p>
<a href="../configuring-components.html#adding-files-to-the-component-configuration">large files and config</a>
</p>



<h2>Transfer</h2>
<p>
File transfer from config servers to nodes is implemented using BitTorrent.
Refer to the <a href="../reference/services-admin.html#filedistribution">filedistribution reference</a>
to configure transfer bitrate.
</p>



<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>
<em>vespa-status-filedistribution</em> can be run to
check if application files have been transferred to all the hosts.
</p>
<p>
The following scenario has occasionally been overserved:
Clients nodes (such as containers) request components from file distribution at reconfiguration,
but the files are never delivered, such that a timeout occur and the node fail to reconfigure.
Log messages starting by <em>Could not install bundle</em>
followed by timeout information is found in the logs.
This can be caused by too many file references (many historical versions of files)
in the file distribution subsystem which for some reason have not been cleaned up - clean up manually:
<pre>
$ zkctl rmr /vespa/filedistribution
$ rm $VESPA_HOME/var/db/vespa/filedistribution/*
</pre>
The first command can be run on any config server node while config servers are running.
The second should be run on all config server nodes.
</p>
