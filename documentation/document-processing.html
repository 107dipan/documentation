This document describes how to develop and deploy Document Processor
<a href="jdisc/container-components.html">components</a>.
To get started with development,
see <a href="getting-started-vespa-applications.html">Vespa Applications</a>.
Read <a href="indexing.html">indexing</a> first to understand deployment and routing.
As document processors are chained components just like Searchers,
read <a href="searcher-development.html">Searcher Development</a>.
For reference, see the
<a href="http://javadoc.io/doc/com.yahoo.vespa/docproc">Javadoc</a>,
and <a href="reference/services-docproc.html">services.xml</a>.
</p><p>
Vespa document processing is a framework to create components called <em>document processors</em>,
that read and modify document operations,
and compose <a href="chained-components.html">chains</a> of many such components.
</p><p>
The input source, typically a crawler, a stream of incoming mail,
data generated from user actions, products or basically anything else,
splits the input data into logical units called <a href="documents.html">documents</a>.
A <a href="writing-to-vespa.html">feeder application</a>
will then send these documents into a document processing chain.
This chain is an ordered list of document processors,
where each processor has one specific task.
This can be anything - examples range from things like language detection,
HTML removal and natural language processing to mail attachment processing,
character set transcoding and image thumbnailing.
At the end of the processing chain, extracted data will typically be
set in some fields in the document, which will continue into a Vespa Content node.

<h2 id="deploying-a-document-processor">Deploying a Document Processor</h2>
<p>
Refer to<a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/tree/master/basic-search-java">
Basic Search Java</a> to get started,
<a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/blob/master/basic-search-java/src/main/java/com/mydomain/example/Rot13DocumentProcessor.java">
    Rot13DocumentProcessor.java</a> / <a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/blob/master/basic-search-java/src/test/java/com/mydomain/example/Rot13DocumentProcessorTest.java">
        Rot13DocumentProcessorTest.java</a> is a document processor example.


The container will create one or more instances of this class
and place it in the document processor chain(s) to process document operations.
The container will create a new instance of this
document processor only when it is reconfigured, so any data needed by
the document processor can be read and prepared from a constructor.
Constructors accept <a href="jdisc/container-components.html">configuration</a>,
as any other pluggable component.
</p><p>
Once built, it can be deployed to the Vespa system which will host it.
The document processor must be packaged as a bundle and added to the Vespa application package,
which is then deployed.
How to create a bundle is described in
<a href="jdisc/developing-osgi-bundles.html">Building OSGi bundles</a>.
To include the document processor in <a href="reference/services-docproc.html">services.xml</a>,
define a document processing chain (here named <em>default</em>) and add document processor to it:
<!-- ToDo: why call it default? routing goes to the default chain -->
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;services version="1.0"&gt;
  &lt;admin version="2.0"&gt;
    &lt;adminserver hostalias="node1" /&gt;
  &lt;/admin&gt;
  &lt;container version="1.0" id="default"&gt;
    &lt;nodes&gt;
      &lt;node hostalias="node1"/&gt;
    &lt;/nodes&gt;
<span style="background-color: yellow;">    &lt;document-processing&gt;
      &lt;chain id="default"&gt;
        &lt;documentprocessor id="com.yahoo.vespatest.Rot13DocumentProcessor"/&gt;
      &lt;/chain&gt;
    &lt;/document-processing&gt;</span>
  &lt;/container&gt;
&lt;/services&gt;
</pre>
</p>



<h2 id="document-processors">Document Processors</h2>
<p>
The components of the docproc container are called <em>document
processors</em>. A document processor is a component (usually deployed
as part of an OSGi bundle) which extends the
class <code>com.yahoo.docproc.DocumentProcessor</code>. All document
processors must implement a single method:
<pre>
public Progress process(Processing processing);
</pre>
When the container receives a document operation, it will create a
new <code>Processing</code>, and add
the <code>DocumentPut</code>s, <code>DocumentUpdate</code>s
or <code>DocumentRemove</code>s to the <code>List</code> accessible
through <code>Processing.getDocumentOperations()</code>. Furthermore, the
call stack of the document processing chain in question will
be <em>copied</em> to <code>Processing.callStack()</code>, so that
document processors may freely modify the flow of control for this
processing without affecting all other processings going on. After
creation, the <code>Processing</code> is added to an internal queue.
</p><p>
A worker thread will retrieve a <code>Processing</code> from the input
queue, and run its document operations through its call stack. A
minimal, no-op document processor implementation is thus:
</p>
<pre>
import com.yahoo.docproc.*;

public class SimpleDocumentProcessor extends DocumentProcessor {
    public Progress process(Processing processing) {
        return Progress.DONE;
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
Clearly, the <code>process()</code> method should loop through all
document operations in <code>Processing.getDocumentOperations()</code>, do
whatever it sees fit to them, and return a Progress. It is acceptable
for a document processor to throw an exception out
of <code>process()</code>.
<pre>
public Progress process(Processing processing) {
    for (DocumentOperation op : processing.getDocumentOperations()) {
        if (op instanceof DocumentPut) {
            DocumentPut put = (DocumentPut) op;
            // TODO do something to 'put here
        } else if (op instanceof DocumentUpdate) {
            DocumentUpdate update = (DocumentUpdate) op;
            // TODO do something to 'update' here
        } else if (op instanceof DocumentRemove) {
            DocumentRemove remove = (DocumentRemove) op;
            // TODO do something to 'remove' here
        }
    }
    return Progress.DONE;
}
</pre>
Possible outcomes of the <code>process()</code> method:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Progress.DONE</dt>
<dd>Returned if a document processor has successfully processed a
    <code>Processing</code>.</dd>
<dt>Progress.FAILED</dt>
<dd>Processing failed and the input message should return
    a <em>fatal</em> failure back to the feeding application, meaning
    that this application will not try to re-feed this document
    operation again.</dd>
<dt>Progress.LATER</dt>
<dd>The document processor wants to release the calling thread and be
    called again later. This is useful if e.g. calling an external
    service with high latency. The document processor may then save
    its state in the <code>Processing</code> and resume when called
    again later. There are no guarantees as to
    <em>when</em> the processor is called again with
    this <code>Processing</code>; it is simply appended to the back of
    the input queue.</dd>
<dt>Throwing a <code>com.yahoo.docproc.TransientFailureException</code></dt>
<dd>Processing failed and the input message should return
    a <em>transient</em> failure back to the feeding application,
    meaning that this application <em>may</em> try to re-feed this
    document operation again.</dd>
<dt>Throwing any other <code>RuntimeException</code></dt>
<dd>Same behavior as for <code>Progress.FAILED</code>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
By the use of <code>Progress.LATER</code>, this is an asynchronous model, where the
processing of a document operation does not need to consume one thread
for its entire lifespan. Note, however, that the document processors
themselves are shared between all processing operations in a chain,
and must thus be implemented in
a <a href="#state-in-document-processors">thread-safe way</a>.
</p><p>
Return an error message/reason by calling <code>withReason()</code>.
<pre>
if (op instanceof DocumentPut) {
    return Progress.FAILED.withReason("PUT is not supported");
}
</pre>
</p>



<h2 id="processing-context-variables">Processing Context Variables</h2>
<p>
The <code>Processing</code> has a map <code>String -&gt; Object</code>
that can be used to pass information between document processors. It
is also very useful when using <code>Progress.LATER</code>, as
discussed above, to save the state of a processing.
<pre>
/** Returns a context variable, or null if it is not set */
public Object getVariable(String name);

/** Returns an iterator of all context variables that are set */
public Iterator&lt;Map.Entry&lt;String, Object&gt;&gt; getVariableAndNameIterator();

/** Clears all context variables that have been set */
public void clearVariables();

/** Sets a context variable. */
public void setVariable(String name, Object value);

/** Removes a context variable. */
public Object removeVariable(String name);

/** Returns true if this variable is present, even if it is null */
public boolean hasVariable(String name);
</pre>
</p>



<h2 id="document-processor-chains">Document Processor Chains</h2>
<p>
The call stack mentioned above is another name for a <em>document
processor chain</em>. Document processor chains are a special case of
the general <a href="chained-components.html">component chains</a> -
to avoid confusion some concepts are explained here as well.
A document processor chain is nothing more than a list of document
processor instances, having an id, and represented as a stack. The
document processor chains are typically not created for every
processing, but are part of the configuration.  Multiple ones may
exist at the same time, the chain to execute will be specified by the
message bus destination of the incoming message. The same document
processor instance may exist in multiple document processor chains,
which is why the <code>CallStack</code> of the <code>Processing</code>
is responsible for knowing the next document processor to invoke in a
particular message.
</p><p>
The execution order of the document processors in a chain are not ordered explicitly,
but by <a href="chained-components.html#ordering-components">ordering
constraints</a> declared in the document processors or their configuration.
</p>



<h2 id="document-processing-execution-model">Document Processing Execution Model</h2>
<p>
The Document Processing Framework works like this:
<ol>
<li>A thread from the message bus layer appends an incoming message to
    an internal priority queue, shared between all document processing
    chains configured on a node. The priority is set based on the
    message bus priority of the message. Messages of the same priority
    are ordered FIFO.</li>
<li>One worker thread from the docproc thread pool picks one message
    from the head of the queue, deserializes it, copies the call stack
    (chain) in question, and runs it through the document processors.</li>
<li>Processing finishes if <strong>(a)</strong> the document(s) has
    passed successfully through the whole chain,
    or <strong>(b)</strong> a document processor in the chain has
    returned Progress.FAILED or thrown an exception.</li>
<li>The same thread passes the message on to the message bus layer for
    further transport on to its destination.</li>
</ol>
There is a single instance of each document processor chain. In every
chain, there is a single instance of each document processor.  (Unless
a chain is configured with multiple, identical document processors
- this is a rare case.)
</p><p>
As is evident from the model above, multiple worker threads execute
the document processors in a chain concurrently. Thus; many threads of
execution can be going through the <code>process()</code> method of a
document processor, at the same time.
</p><p>
This model places a very important constraint on document processor classes:
<em>instance variables are not safe.</em> They must be eliminated, or
made threadsafe somehow.
</p>



<h2 id="state-in-document-processors">State in Document Processors</h2>
<p>
Any state in the document processor for the particular Processing
should be kept as local variables in the process method,
while state which should be shared by all Processings should
be kept as member variables. As the latter kind will be accessed by
multiple threads at any one time, the state of such member variables
must be <em>threadsafe</em>.
This critical restriction is similar to those of e.g. the Servlet API.
Options for implementing a multithread-safe document processor with instance variables:
<ol>
<li>Use immutable (and preferably final) objects: they never change
    after they are constructed; no modifications to their state occurs
    after the DocumentProcessor constructor returns.</li>
<li>Use a single instance of a thread-safe class.</li>
<li>Create a single instance and synchronize access to it across all
    threads (but this will severely limit your scalability).</li>
<li>Arrange for each thread to have its own instance, e.g. with
    a <code>ThreadLocal</code>.</li>
</ol>
</p>



<h2 id="asynchronous-execution">Asynchronous Execution</h2>
<p>
The execution model outlined above also shows one important
restriction: If a document processor performs any high-latency
operation in its process() method, a docproc worker thread will be
occupied. With all <em>n</em> worker threads blocking on an external
resource, throughput will be severely limited. This can be alleviated
by saving the state in the Processing object, and returning
<code>Progress.LATER</code>.
A document processor doing a high-latency operation should use a pattern like this:
<ol>
<li>Check a self-defined context variable in Processing for
    status. Basically, <em>have we seen this Processing before?</em></li>
<li>If no:
    <ol>
    <li>We have been given a Processing object fresh off the network,
        we have not seen this before. Process it up until the
        high-latency operation.</li>
    <li>Start the high-latency operation (possibly in a separate
        thread).</li>
    <li>Save the state of the operation in a self-defined context
        variable in the Processing.</li>
    <li>Return Progress.LATER. This Processing is the appended to the
        back of the input queue, and we will be called again
        later.</li>
    </ol></li>
<li>If yes:
   <ol>
   <li>Retrieve the reference that we set in our self-defined context
       variable in Processing.</li>
   <li>Is the high-latency operation done? If so, return Progress.DONE.</li>
   <li>Is it not yet done? Return Progress.LATER again.</li>
   </ol></li>
</ol>
As is evident, this will let the finite set of document processing
threads to perform more work at the same time.
</p>



<h2 id="reconfiguring-document-processing">Reconfiguring Document Processing</h2>
<p>
Consider the following configuration:
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
&lt;services version="1.0"&gt;
  &lt;container version="1.0" id="default"&gt;
    &lt;document-processing&gt;
      &lt;chain id="default"&gt;
        &lt;documentprocessor id="SomeDocumentProcessor"&gt;
          &lt;config name="foo.something"&gt;
            &lt;variable&gt;value&lt;/variable&gt;
          &lt;/config&gt;
        &lt;/documentprocessor&gt
      &lt;/chain&gt;
    &lt;/document-processing&gt;
  &lt;/container&gt;
&lt;/services&gt;
</pre>
Changing chain ids, components in a chain, component configuration,
and schema mapping all takes effect after
<a href="cloudconfig/application-packages.html#deploy">vespa-deploy activate</a> -
no restart required. Changing <em>cluster names</em> (i.e. the jdisc id)
requires a restart of docproc services after <em>vespa-deploy activate</em>.
</p>


<hr />

<h2 id="design-goals">Design goals</h2>
<p>
The framework is designed to meet these goals:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Developer friendliness</strong>. It must be so simple to
      write a simple processor that anybody can do it. This is a complete processor:
<pre>
import com.yahoo.document.*;
import com.yahoo.docproc.*;

public class ExampleDocumentProcessor extends DocumentProcessor {

    public Progress process(Processing processing) {
        for (DocumentOperation op : processing.getDocumentOperations()) {
            if (op instanceof DocumentPut) {
                Document document = ((DocumentPut) op).getDocument();
                //TODO do something to 'document' here
            } else if (op instanceof DocumentUpdate) {
                DocumentUpdate update = (DocumentUpdate) op;
                //TODO do something to 'update' here
            } else if (op instanceof DocumentRemove) {
                DocumentRemove remove = (DocumentRemove) op;
                //TODO do something to 'remove' here
            }
        }
        return Progress.DONE;
    }
}
</pre></li>

<li><strong>Gradual learning</strong>. More advanced concepts needed
    for processing multiple documents or document updates, making
    control decisions and so on builds on, and extends naturally the
    basic concepts learned when doing simple processing.</li>

<li><strong>Scaling</strong>. The framework must allow cheap scaling
    by document size, document count and document processing clock
    time. The document processing framework uses a completely
    asynchronous architecture to allow scaling in several of these
    dimensions at the same time.</li>

<li><strong>Simplicity</strong>. The core framework consists of less
    than ten classes totaling less than thousand lines of source. It
    has one dependency - to a minimal document model (a few more
    classes) modelling documents as a named map of fields.</li>

<li><strong>Embedding</strong>. The framework does not make any
    assumptions about the context in which it will run. It can be
    embedded in another application which handles the thread
    management, configuration and so on.</li>

<li><strong>Vespa integration.</strong> The framework may also run as
    a Vespa service. Configuration through Vespa, logging to Vespa and
    remote capabilities are handled by optional add-on packages.</li>

<li><strong>Plugin support</strong>. Document processors developed by
    applications can be deployed and un-deployed in the framework, run
    without compromising the framework instance even if they contain
    errors, and be binary compatible across different versions of the
    framework. This is handled by developing the framework in Java and
    loading the document processors as OSGi components.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="core-features">Core Features</h2>
<p>
The framework core supports asynchronous processing, processing one or
multiple documents or document updates at the same time,
document processors that makes dynamic decisions about the processing flow and
passing of information between processors outside the document or document update:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>One or more named <strong>Docproc Services</strong> may be created.
    One of the services is the <em>default</em>.</li>

  <li>A service accepts subclasses of <strong>DocumentOperation</strong>
      for processing, which currently
      means <strong>DocumentPuts</strong>, <strong>DocumentUpdates</strong>
      and <strong>DocumentRemoves</strong>. It has a <strong>Call
      Stack</strong> which lists the calls to make to
      various <strong>Document Processors</strong> to process each
      DocumentOperation handed to the service.</li>

  <li>Call Stacks consist of <strong>Calls</strong>, which refer to
      the Document Processor instance to call.</li>

  <li>DocumentPuts and document updates are processed asynchronously, the
      state is kept in a Processing for its duration (instead of in a
      thread or process). A Document Processor may make some
      asynchronous calls (typically to remote services) and return to
      the framework that it should be called again later for the same
      Processing to handle the outcome of the calls.</li>

  <li>A processing contains its own copy of the Call Stack of the
      Docproc Service to keep track of what to call next.  Document
      Processors may modify this Call Stack to dynamically decide the
      processing steps required to process a DocumentOperation.</li>

  <li>A Processing may contain one or more DocumentOperations to be
      processed as a unit.</li>

  <li>A Processing has a <em>context</em>, which is a Map of named
      values which can be used to pass arguments between processors.</li>

  <li>Processings are prepared to be stored to disk to allow a very
      high number of ongoing long-term processings per node.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="additional-features">Additional Features</h2>
<p>
Outside the common core, there are optional packages which provides the following:
<ul>
<li>Configuration using Vespa Configuration. Docproc Services with
    Call Stacks can be configured from file or a configuration server
    using the Vespa Configuration System. Document processors may also
    easily get own sub Call Stacks configured using the configuration system.</li>
</ul>
</p>
