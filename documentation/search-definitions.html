title: "Search Definitions"

<p>
Data in Vespa is modeled as <a href="documents.html">Documents</a>.
<em>Search Definitions</em> configure the document types
and how they should be stored, indexed, ranked, searched and presented.
A vague analogy is a <em>schema</em>.
Documents adhere strictly to a configured <em>document type</em>.
A Vespa system can have multiple document types and each document type
is defined in a <em>search definition</em>.
The values in each field have an associated data type like string, long,
array - see the <a href="reference/search-definitions-reference.html#field_types">
search definitions reference</a> for a complete list.
</p><p>
Some commonly used field properties are described in this document -
there are other properties that provide finer control over ranking,
linguistics and other advanced features.
Read more in the <a href="reference/search-definitions-reference.html">
search definition reference</a>.
</p><p>
Search definition files have suffix <em>.sd</em>,
and the prefix must be the same as the search name described inside.
Vespa applications must have at least one search definition in the
<a href="cloudconfig/application-packages.html">application package</a> -
the search definition is a required file.
</p><p>
A document has a unique <em>Document Id</em>.
Documents can have relations - read more about <a href="#document-references">document references</a>.
</p><p>
Search definitions can be <a href="#modify-search-definitions">modified without restarts</a>.
</p><p>
Example
<a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/blob/master/basic-search/src/main/application/searchdefinitions/music.sd">
music.sd</a>:
<pre>
search music {
    document music {
        field artist type string {
            indexing: summary | index
        }

        field artistId type string {
            indexing: summary | attribute
        }

        field title type string {
            indexing: summary | index
        }

        field album type string {
            indexing: index
        }

        field duration type int {
            indexing: summary
        }

        field year type int {
            indexing: summary | attribute
        }

        field popularity type int {
            indexing: summary | attribute
        }
    }

    fieldset default {
        fields: artist, title, album
    }

    rank-profile song inherits default {
        first-phase {
            expression:nativeRank(artist,title,album) + if(isNan(attribute(popularity)) == 1, 0,attribute(popularity))
        }
    }
}
</pre>
</p>



<h2 id="indexing">indexing</h2>
<p>
<code>indexing</code> configures how to process data of a field during indexing -
the most important ones are:
<table class="table">
  <thead></thead><tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>index</code></td><td>
        Make this field's content part of a searchable index.
        <a href="reference/search-definitions-reference.html#indexing">Reference</a></td>
    </tr><tr>
      <td><code>attribute</code></td><td>
        Create an in-memory attribute to enable sorting or grouping.
        Note some <a href="reference/search-definitions-reference.html#match">
        match methods</a> are not available for attributes.
        <a href="reference/search-definitions-reference.html#attribute">Reference</a> /
        <a href="attributes.html">attribute details</a></td>
    </tr><tr>
      <td><code>summary</code></td><td>
        Include this field in the document summary in search result sets.
        <a href="reference/search-definitions-reference.html#summary">Reference</a></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
Indexing instructions have pipeline semantics similar to unix shell
commands, with data flowing from left to right.
They can perform complex transformations on field values,
or just send the field value unchanged to the next sections of the index structure - example:
<pre>
indexing: summary | attribute | index
</pre>
The data is first added to the document summary, then added as an
in-memory attribute and finally indexed.
The indexing language offers more functionality than this,
like filter field values, combine field values, select on different values.
Learn more in the <a href="reference/advanced-indexing-language.html">
indexing language</a> reference.
</p>



<h2 id="fieldset">fieldset</h2>
<p>
A <code>fieldset</code> groups fields together for searching - example:
<pre>
search/?query=title:sometitle default:someword
</pre>
This query returns documents having <em>sometitle</em> in the field <em>title</em>,
and <em>someword</em> in one or more of the fields in the fieldset <em>default</em>.
If no field/field set name is given for a search term, the fieldset named <em>default</em> is searched.
Find details in the <a href="reference/search-definitions-reference.html#fieldset">fieldset reference</a>.
</p>



<h2 id="rank-profile">rank-profile</h2>
<p>
Vespa has built-in rank profiles, and/or such profiles can be configured,
by hand or using machine learning.
Read more in the <a href="ranking.html">ranking</a> documentation.
</p>



<h2 id="document-references">Document references</h2>
<p>
Documents can refer to other documents using
<a href="reference/search-definitions-reference.html#type:reference">references</a>
to <a href="content/data-placement.html#global-documents">global documents</a>.
Using a reference, fields can be
<a href="reference/search-definitions-reference.html#import-field">imported</a>
from parent types into the child's search definition and used for matching, ranking, grouping and sorting.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> This feature is ready for production for applications
with a data distribution where all documents are on each node.
<!-- ToDo: remove this when supporting distributed... -->
</p>

<p>
Example:
<pre>
search campaign {
    document campaign {
        field budget type int { indexing : attribute }
    }
}
</pre>
<pre>
[
  { "put": "id:test:campaign::thebest", "fields": { "budget": 20 } },
  { "put": "id:test:campaign::nextbest", "fields": { "budget": 10 } }
]
</pre>
<pre>
search salesperson {
    document salesperson {
        field name type string { indexing: attribute }
    }
}
</pre>
<pre>
[
  { "put": "id:test:salesperson::johndoe", "fields": { "name": "John Doe" } }
]
</pre>
<pre>
search ad {
    document ad {
        field campaign_ref type <span style="background-color: yellow;">reference&lt;campaign&gt;</span> {
            indexing: attribute
        }
        field other_campaign_ref type reference&lt;campaign&gt; {
            indexing: attribute
        }
        field salesperson_ref type reference&lt;salesperson&gt; {
            indexing: attribute
        }
    }
        
    <span style="background-color: yellow;">import field campaign_ref.budget as budget</span> {}
    import field salesperson_ref.name as salesperson_name {}
}
</pre>
<pre>
[
  { "put": "id:test:ad::1", "fields": {
      "campaign_ref": "id:test:campaign::thebest",
      "other_campaign_ref": "id:test:campaign::nextbest",
      "salesperson_ref": "id:test:salesperson::johndoe" }
  }
]
</pre>
Document type <em>ad</em> has two references to <em>campaign</em> (via <em>campaign_ref</em>
and <em>other_campaign_ref</em>) and one reference to <em>salesperson</em> (via <em>salesperson_ref</em>).
The <em>budget</em> field from <em>campaign</em> is imported into the <em>ad</em> search definition
(via <em>campaign_ref</em>) and given the name <em>budget</em>. Similarly, the <em>name</em> of
<em>salesperson</em> is imported as <em>salesperson_name</em>.
</p>
<p>
Using the parent-child relationship, data does not have to be normalized,
as fields from parents are imported into children.
Use this to update parent fields to limit number of updates if a field's value
is shared beween many documents.
This also limits the resources (memory / disk) required to store and handle documents on content nodes.
</p>
</p>
As global documents are distributed to all nodes, node capacity will limit
the number of such documents. Global documents are hence called parents -
there are usually less parents than children. Note that parents can have parents.
</p>
<p>
The following type of references are not supported:
<ul>
  <li>
    Self-reference.
  </li>
  <li>
    Transitive reference.
    A document type <em>child</em> cannot import fields from it's <em>grandparent</em>
    via a reference to <em>parent</em> (and its reference to <em>grandparent</em>).
    In this case <em>child</em> needs an explicit reference to <em>grandparent</em>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cyclic reference.
    If document type <em>foo</em> has a reference to <em>bar</em>,
    then <em>bar</em> cannot have a reference to <em>foo</em>.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>


<h2 id="document-expiry">Document expiry</h2>
<p>
To auto-expire documents, use a <a href="reference/services-content.html#documents.selection">
selection</a> with <a href="reference/advanced-indexing-language.html#now">now</a>.
Example, keep <em>music</em>-documents for a day:
<pre>
&lt;documents garbage-collection="true"&gt;
  &lt;document type="music" selection="music.timestamp > now() - 86400" &gt;
&lt;/documents&gt;
</pre>
The <em>timestamp</em>-field must have values in seconds since EPOCH:
<pre>
field timestamp type long {
    indexing: attribute
    attribute {
        fast-access
    }
}
</pre>
Notes:
<ul>
  <li>
    Using a <em>selection</em> with <em>now</em> can have side effects
    when re-feeding or re-processing documents, as timestamps can be stale.
    A common problem is feeding with too old timestamps,
    resulting in no documents being indexed.
  </li><li>
    Deploying a configuration where the selection string selects no documents
    will cause all documents to be garbage collected.
    Use <a href="content/visiting.html">visit</a> to test the selection string.
    Garbage collected documents are not to be expected to be recoverable.
  </li><li>
    When using this feature, <a href="reference/services-content.html#searchable-copies">
    searchable copies</a> in a content cluster should be the same as
    the <a href="reference/services-content.html#redundancy">redundancy</a> and the
    selection expression should only reference fields that are attribute vectors.
    Otherwise, the document selection maintenance will be slow and have a major
    performance impact on the system.
  </li>
</ul>
</p><p>
To batch remove, set a selection that matches no documents, like <em>"!music"</em>
</p>



<h2 id="multiple-dearch-definitions">Multiple Search Definitions</h2>
<p>
Some applications need to search more than one kind of data,
each described by its own search definition.
There are two ways to do this:
<ol>
<li>Deploy multiple search definitions to one indexed content cluster</li>
<li>Deploy each search definition in a separate indexed content cluster</li>
</ol>
In both solutions, the search container will be used to blend results
for searches that query multiple search definitions -
below is pros and cons of each approach, as well as how to configure.
</p><p>
It is possible to combine the two methods,
having some clusters serving one large search definition each,
in combination with other clusters serving many small search definitions.
</p>


<h3 id="multiple-search-definitions-in-one-indexed-content-cluster">Multiple Search Definitions in one indexed content cluster</h3>
<p><!-- ToDo check this - maybe supported for streaming, then simplify -->
Vespa is able to serve multiple search definitions (document types) from the same
indexed content cluster (this is not supported for streaming indexing mode).
This is done inside the Vespa search core, but it still behaves in
most ways as a collection of clusters each serving one document type;
so a search that queries multiple search definitions will still be
split before it is sent from the container, even if the same search core
process will handle several types.
<ul>
<li>You need to manage only one instance of the set of search
    processes regardless of the number of search definitions.</li>
<li>You can no longer start, stop, or otherwise manage the serving for
    the different search definitions independently, since they are
    running in the same process.</li>
<li>Even if you want different physical clusters at runtime it may be
    convenient to use this feature during development as it makes it
    easier to develop and test on a single node.</li>
</ul>
To enable, add the .sd-file and configure the document type (example below) - then deploy:
<pre>
&lt;documents&gt;
  &lt;document mode="index" type="book" /&gt;
  &lt;document mode="index" type="pc" /&gt;
  &lt;document mode="index" type="sock" /&gt;
&lt;/documents&gt;
</pre>
</p>


<h3 id="multiple-indexed-content-clusters">Multiple indexed content clusters</h3>
<p>
Vespa can query multiple indexed content clusters for each search
and do customizable blending of the results at the container level.
Each indexed content cluster can be configured with its own search definition (document type).
The consequences of this, compared to the method above, are as follows:
<ul>
<li>You will need to manage one instance of the entire set of search
    processes for each kind of search definition.</li>
<li>You can separate different types of loads on different machines
    (say one search definitions has big documents and needs lots of
    disk space, another has many small documents with attributes that
    just need memory).</li>
<li>You can manage the processes separately (so you can stop serving
    one document type and delete the indexes for it without impacting
    the other types).</li>
</ul>
To use this feature, configure multiple indexed content clusters,
each having one search definition and selecting one kind of document.
Below is an example of a Vespa setup configuration using three nodes
to set up three indexed content clusters:
<pre>
&lt;content version="1.0" id="book"&gt;
  &lt;redundancy&gt;1&lt;/redundancy&gt;
  &lt;documents&gt;
    &lt;document mode="index" type="book"/&gt;
  &lt;/documents&gt;
  &lt;group&gt;
    &lt;node distribution-key="0" hostalias="HOST1"/&gt;
  &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/content&gt;
&lt;content version="1.0" id="pc"&gt;
  &lt;redundancy&gt;1&lt;/redundancy&gt;
  &lt;documents&gt;
    &lt;document mode="index" type="pc"/&gt;
  &lt;/documents&gt;
  &lt;group&gt;
    &lt;node distribution-key="0" hostalias="HOST2"/&gt;
  &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/content&gt;
&lt;content version="1.0" id="sock"&gt;
  &lt;redundancy&gt;1&lt;/redundancy&gt;
  &lt;documents&gt;
    &lt;document mode="index" type="sock"/&gt;
  &lt;/documents&gt;
  &lt;group&gt;
    &lt;node distribution-key="0" hostalias="HOST3"/&gt;
  &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/content&gt;
</pre>
No restarts are needed when adding clusters (assuming no content host overlap) -
also refer to <a href="operations/admin-procedures.html">admin procedures</a>.
</p>



<h2 id="document-inheritance">Document Inheritance</h2>
<p>
Regardless of how you choose to deploy your search definitions,
it is likely that some of them contains fields that are common across some or all of the documents.
Vespa supports <em>document inheritance</em> to collect those documents in one or more super-documents.
To search across different search definitions with one search,
you <em>should</em> define common fields in superclasses.
The result is not well defined when you search a field that is defined independently
by two different search definitions.
</p><p>
To let a document inherit another,
just add <code>inherits [document-name]</code> after the document name.
Multiple inheritance is also supported, for example:
<pre>
  document cod inherits food, fish {
    &hellip;
  }
</pre>
Multiple levels of inheritance works as well, fish may inherit animal and so on.
</p>


<h3 id="overriding-super-fields">Overriding Super-Fields</h3>
<p>
Overriding super-fields is not allowed. However there are other ways
you can do this.  Keep in mind that only documents are inherited. The
recommended way is to separate the definition of the field and the search
specific stuff. Create an external field which takes the physical
field as input and does the search specific stuff.  This can be done in
both base and inherited type. This leaves full freedom to do whatever
you like.
</p>


<h3 id="sharing-super-documents-across-indexed-content-clusters">Sharing Super-Documents Across Indexed Content Clusters</h3>
<p>
If you have multiple indexed content clusters,
you may want to have search definitions containing documents
which should be available for inheriting in multiple indexed content clusters.
To do this, you need to list them in the <code>documents</code> tag,
along with the other search definitions. For example:
<pre>
&lt;content version="1.0" id="myid"&gt;
  &lt;documents&gt;
    &lt;document mode="index" type="base" /&gt;
  &lt;/documents&gt;
  &hellip;
&lt;/content&gt;
</pre>
</p>



<h2 id="searching-multiple-document-types">Searching multiple document types</h2>
<p>
In an application with multiple types of data, decide which data to search in each query.
Read up on <a href="federation.html">federation</a> before continuing.
The following always apply:
<ul>
<li>
  Vespa will by default search all document types and all clusters in parallel,
  and blend results based on relevancy.
  A query may end up with just hits of one type, or some mixture of different data,
  depending on which type had the most relevant results.
  It is possible to define different ranking for each search definition,
  and Vespa will apply the correct ranking for each hit,
  depending on the document type.</li>
<li>
  To limit the search to a subset of the types inside indexed content clusters,
  set <a href="reference/search-api-reference.html#model.restrict">restrict</a> to
  a comma-separated list of search definition (document type) names.
  This is typically used when having multiple document types
  in one cluster (method 1). Example:
<pre>
/search/?query=lotr&amp;<span style="background-color: yellow;">restrict=music,book</span>
</pre></li>
<li>To limit the search to a subset of the indexed content clusters,
  set <a href="reference/search-api-reference.html#model.sources">sources</a> to
  a comma-separated list of indexed content cluster names.
  This is typically used when having multiple clusters
  with one document type in each (method 2). Example:
<pre>
/search/?query=lotr&amp;<span style="background-color: yellow;">sources=music_cluster,book_cluster</span>
</pre></li>
<li>
  To specify the number of results to return of each type,
  instead of letting this be decided by relevancy,
  either submit one request per type, or write a <a href="searcher-development.html">searcher</a>.</li>
<li>
  The blending of hits from different sources is limited to simple relevancy blending.
  For more sophisticated blending, e.g. include a minimum number of hits of each type,
  prefer some type of results over others for certain queries and so on,
  write a <a href="searcher-development.html">searcher</a>.</li>
<li>
  Searches to indexes that are only present in some of the sources
  will not return results from other sources (that is, this works as expected).</li>
<li>
  The behavior of Vespa is undefined if searching for an index which has the same name,
  <em>but different attributes</em> across multiple search definitions
  (one will not get entirely correct results).
  It is legal to change relevancy boosts and relevancy type.</li>
<li>
  In addition to blending the hits,
  Vespa will also unify grouping information about the same field
  from multiple document types.</li>
</ul>
The above is true regardless of whether using multiple document
types in one cluster (method 1) or multiple clusters (method 2).
A search in a Vespa installation having multiple clusters is
dispatched to all (selected) clusters in parallel.
When multiple types are deployed on one cluster (method 1)
it behaves just the same, the search is dispatched in parallel multiple times
(one for each selected document type), now to the same indexed content cluster.
</p>



<h2 id="modify-search-definitions">Modify Search Definitions</h2>
<p>
This section describes how a search definition in a live application can be modified - categories:
<ol>
  <li><a href="#valid-changes-without-restart-or-re-feed">
    Valid changes without restart or re-feed</a></li>
  <li><a href="#changes-that-require-restart-but-not-re-feed">
    Changes that require restart but not re-feed</a></li>
  <li><a href="#changes-that-require-re-feed">
    Changes that require re-feed</a></li>
</ol>
When running <code>vespa-deploy prepare</code> on a new application package,
the changes in the search definition files are compared with the files in the current active package.
If some of the changes require restart or re-feed, the output from <code>vespa-deploy prepare</code>
specifies which actions are needed.
</p><p>
Note: If there are changes to perform on a live
system that are not covered by this document and no output is given from <code>vespa-deploy prepare</code>,
their impact is undefined and in no way guaranteed to allow a system to stay live until re-feeding.
Changes not related to the search definition are discussed
in <a href="operations/admin-procedures.html">admin procedures</a>.
</p><p>
It is best practise to try changes in a staging system first.
</p>

Example: Given an indexed content cluster <em>search</em>:
<pre>
search test {
  document test {
    field f1 type string { indexing: summary }
  }
}
</pre>
Then add field <code>f1</code> as an index:
<pre>
search test {
  document test {
    field f1 type string { indexing: index | summary }
  }
}
</pre>
The following is output from <code>vespa-deploy prepare</code> -
which re-feed actions are needed:
<pre>
WARNING: Change(s) between active and new application that require re-feed:
Re-feed document type 'test' in cluster 'basicsearch' because:
    1) Document type 'test': Field 'f1' changed: add index aspect, indexing script: '{ input f1 | summary f1; }' -&gt; '{ input f1 | tokenize normalize stem:"SHORTEST" | index f1 | summary f1; }'
</pre>
</p>
