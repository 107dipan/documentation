Vespa comes with a set of sample use case applications, each highlighting
various aspects of Vespa features. These are designed to be fairly self
contained including sample data. They can be used to learn how to use
different features with links to relevant documentation, or as a starting point
for new similar applications.

More applications will be added soon.
