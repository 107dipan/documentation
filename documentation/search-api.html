<p>
Search with Vespa using HTTP GET requests. HTTP keepalive is supported.
Refer to the <a href="reference/search-api-reference.html">search API</a>.
The general form of a search request is:
<pre>
http://&lt;qrs-host&gt;:&lt;qrs-port&gt;/search/?&lt;param1=value1&gt;&amp;&lt;param2=value2&gt;&hellip;
</pre>
QRS (Query Result Server) is the service accepting Vespa search requests.
The only mandatory parameter is <code>query</code> or <code>yql</code> - examples:
<pre>
http://host:port/search/?query=rose
http://host:port/search/?query=kanoo%20bathing&amp;hits=10
</pre>
The last query has a query string consisting of multiple words. In
cases where the parameter values contains non-alphanumeric characters,
the values must be encoded according to standard URL encoding
rules. Thus, space is encoded as %20, + as %2b and so on -
see <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt">RFC 2396</a>.
</p>



<h2 id="query-strings">Query Strings</h2>
<p>
The most important piece of the query request is the query string.
The query string contains the specification of which results the search should return,
typically some words which should be present in matching documents.
The Vespa Query Language comes in two flavors:
<ul>
<li>The <strong>simple</strong> query language is intended to be usable directly
    by end users. It has four
    <a href="reference/simple-query-language-syntax.html#simple">subtypes</a>,
    where <em>all</em> is the default.  Its main purpose
    is <em>robustness</em> - it makes the most out of any strange piece
    of text which may be given to a search engine by an end user.
    This is the default in Vespa.</li>
<li>The <strong>advanced</strong> query syntax is intended for programmatic
    use. Queries are formulated in <a href="query-language.html">YQL</a>
    which should be used when building applications.</li>
</ul>
See the <a href="reference/simple-query-language-syntax.html">simple query language reference</a>.
</p><p>
If Vespa cannot determine a valid search expression from the query string,
it will issue the error message <em>Null query</em>.
To troubleshoot, add <a href="reference/search-api-reference.html#tracelevel">&amp;tracelevel=2</a>
to the GET request. A missing query/yql parameter will also lead to this error message.
</p>


<h3 id="simple-query-syntax">Simple Query Syntax</h3>
<p>
The <em>simple</em> query language syntax accepts any input string and
makes the most of it. A basic query consists of words separated by
spaces (encoded as %20). In addition,
<ul>
<li>A phrase can be searched by enclosing it in quotes, like
    <code>"match exactly this"</code></li>
<li>Phrases and words may be preceded by -, meaning documents <em>must
    not</em> contain this</li>
<li>Phrases and words may be preceded by +, meaning documents
    <em>must</em> contain this, currently only in use for
    subtype <code>any</code></li>
<li>Groups of words and phrases may be grouped using parenthesis, like
    <code>-(do not match if all of these words matches)</code></li>
<li>Each word or phrase may be preceded by an index or attribute name
    and a colon, like <code>indexname:word</code>, to match in that
    index. If the index name is omitted the index
    named <em>default</em> is searched.</li>
</ul>
Any <em>noise</em> (characters not in indexes or attributes,
and with no query language meaning) is ignored, all query strings are valid.
The exception is queries which have no meaningful interpretation.
An example is <code>-a</code>, which one would expect to return
all documents <em>not</em> containing <em>a</em>.
Vespa, however, will return the error message <em>Null query</em>.
All the following examples are of type <em>all</em>.
</p><p>
Get all documents with the word <em>word</em>,
having <em>microsoft</em> but not <em>bug</em> in the title:
<pre>word title:microsoft -title:bug</pre>
Search for all documents having the phrase "<em>to be or not not be</em>",
but excluding those having <em>shakespeare</em> in the title:
<pre>"to be or not to be" -title:shakespeare</pre>
Get all documents with the word <em>Christmas</em> in the title that
were last modified Christmas Day 2009:
<pre>title:Christmas date:20091225</pre>
Get documents on US Foreign politics, excluding those matching both
rival presidential candidates:
<pre>"us foreign politics" -(clinton trump)</pre>
Get documents on US Foreign politics, including only those matching at
least one of the rival presidential candidates:
<pre>"us foreign politics" (clinton trump)</pre>
</p>



<h2 id="other-query-params">Other Query Parameters</h2>
<p>
In addition to the query string itself, Vespa accepts a number of
parameters which describes how to match documents, order results,
present results and how to provide additional information about the
hits. The following lists the most important parameters, a full
listing is found in the
<a href="reference/search-api-reference.html">search API reference</a>,
including information on search chains and query profiles.
It is also possible to use locations for <a href="geo-search.html">Geo search</a>.
<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Parameter</th><th>Description</th>
  </tr>

<tbody>
<tr><td><code>query</code></td>
  <td>the query, described above</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>type</code></td>
  <td>the query type (all, web, any, phrase, adv), described
      above</td></tr>

  <td>an additional <em>any</em> type query string used to limit or

      generated query terms or preset preferences to a user query,

      end</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>tracelevel</code></td>
  <td>set to a positive integer to see tracing information in the
      query result. Higher numbers produce more tracing
      output.</td></tr>

      this query to finish. This overrides any default values set in query profiles,

<h2 id="default-result-format">Default Result Format</h2>
<p>
The default output format is JSON as defined in the
<a href="./reference/default-result-format.html#default-json">reference</a>.
The basic structure is:
<pre>
{
    "root": {
        "children": [
            objects with same structure as root itself...
        ],
        "fields": {
            "document field name": "document field contents",
            â€¦
        }
    }
}
</pre>
