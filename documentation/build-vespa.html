<p>
To build all Vespa components, use Docker and CentOS as described at
<a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa/tree/master/docker">
  github.com/vespa-engine/vespa/tree/master/docker</a>.
This is done in the <a href="vespa-quick-start.html">quick-start</a>,
and provides a runtime environment in the Docker instance.
</p><p>
To develop with Vespa, build the Vespa Java artifacts - in
<a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa">vespa</a>:
<pre>
$ ./bootstrap.sh java &amp;&amp; mvn install
</pre>
</p><p>
Once built, Vespa artifacts are ready to be used and one can build a Vespa application
using the <a href="bundle-plugin.html">bundle plugin</a>.
