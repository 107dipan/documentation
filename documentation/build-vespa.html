<p>
To develop with Vespa, follow the guide
<a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa#building">here</a>
to setup a development environment on CentOS 7 using Docker.
Building only Vespa Java artifacts can be done on any platform having Java 11 and Maven installed:
<pre>
$ export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xms128m -Xmx1024m"
$ ./bootstrap.sh java &amp;&amp; mvn install
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Once built, Vespa Java artifacts are ready to be used and one can build a Vespa application
using the <a href="bundle-plugin.html">bundle plugin</a>.
