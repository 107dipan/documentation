<p>
This document describes how to use Weak And/WAND for complex type any queries.
This document uses conceps and data set from the <a href="tutorials/blog-search.html">blog search tutorial</a>
</p><p>
Both Wand query operator implementations in Vespa
<ul>
  <li>accepts the targeted number of hits to be returned</li>
  <li>accepts a score threshold </li>
</ul>
</p>



<h2 id="weakand">weakAnd</h2>
<p>
The <a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#weakand">weakAnd query operator</a>
accepts terms searching over multiple fields and also logical conjuctions using OR/AND etc.
</p><p>
WeakAnd is also called <em>Vespa Wand</em> in this documentation.
</p><p>
With the complete blog search data set,
we could imagine a user query <em>blogs about adidas joggers or white nike's or reebook</em>
which could be represented in the <a href="query-language.html">Vespa Query Language</a> as:
<pre>
select * from blog_post where (
  default contains "blog" OR default contains "about" OR 
  default contains "adidas" OR default contains "joggers" OR default contains "or" OR 
  default contains "white" OR 
  default contains phrase("nike", "s") OR default contains "or" OR default contains "reebook"
);
</pre>
The query would recall about 462,857 documents out of a total corpus of 1,196,110 documents,
which equals roughly 39% of the total corpus.
Vespa will rank all those recalled documents using the configured <em>first-phase</em> ranking function.
Using the <em>weakAnd</em> query operator the query could look like:
<pre>
select * from blog_post where (
  [{"targetNumHits": 200}] 
    weakAnd(
      default contains "blog", default contains "about", default contains "adidas", 
      default contains "joggers", default contains "or", default contains "white", 
      default contains phrase("nike", "s"), default contains "reebook"
    )
);
</pre>
We specify that the target number of hits (top k) should be 200 (Default 100)
and this number is used per content node.
In the case of weakAnd,
Vespa returns a total of 3342 documents (out of the actual 462,857 matching the logical disjunction).
Those 3342 documents are evaluated using the configured <em>first-phase</em> ranking expression
as configured in the rank-profile.
The weakAnd implementation scores documents by a simplified scoring function,
which uses two core text rank features:
<ul>
  <li><a href="reference/rank-features.html#term(n).significance">term(n).significance</a></li>
  <li><a href="reference/rank-features.html#term(n).weight">term(n).weight</a></li>
</ul>
Both features could be overridden in the query using
<a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#annotations">annotations</a>:
<pre>
select * from blog_post where (
  [{"targetNumHits": 200}] 
    weakAnd(
      default contains "blog", default contains "about", default contains ([{"weight":200}]"adidas")
    )
);
</pre>
The inner scoring function of the <em>weakAnd</em> operator is:
<pre>
rank_score = sum_n(term(n).significance * term(n).weight) 
</pre>
Documents that could not potentially compete with any of the hits already in heap of top hits(targetNumHits) are skipped,
while still the weakAnd implementation exposes all hits which were evaluated to the first phase ranking function,
and not only the top k hits.
</p>


<h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>
<p>
In the <a href="tutorials/blog-search.html#blog-popularity-signal">blog search tutorial</a>,
a document <em>popularity</em> ranking feature is introduced
and which is used in the <em>first-phase</em> ranking function in addition to text matching features:
<pre>
rank-profile post_popularity inherits default {
    first-phase {
        expression: nativeRank(title, content) + 10 * if(isNan(attribute(popularity)), 0, attribute(popularity))
    }
}
</pre>
As described earlier, the <em>weakAnd</em> inner ranking function is only considering the <em>term(n).weight</em>
and <em>term(n).significance</em>.
It has no knowledge of the <em>first-phase</em> function in use.
With the above ranking function,
the correlation between the simple inner weakAnd scoring and the first phase function would be weak,
and the most popular blog posts might not appear at all in the top k weakAnd scored hits.
</p>


<h3 id="benefits">Benefits</h3>
<ul>
  <li>It's accepts any field and query terms can search different fields and has great performance.</li>
  <li>It's integrated with linguistics so whatever stemming and linguistic settings is configured is applied
    including also bolding of query terms.</li>
  <li>It is using the same query terms for other more advanced ranking expressions like nativeRank/nativeFieldMatch.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="wand">wand</h2>
<p>
The <a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#wand">wand query operator</a>
works over a single field only and it accepts a list of features or pre-processed text tokens with weights.
It allows full control over both query side weights and document side weights
and it's guaranteed that it will find the top K best hits ranked by the dotProduct
between the query and the document side feature vectors.
</p><p>
WeakAnd is also called <em>Vespa Wand</em> in this documentation.
</p><p>
See <a href="advanced-ranking.html">Advanced ranking</a> documentation on how to use the wand operator.
Note that this operator does not integrate with <a href="linguistics.html">linguistic processing</a>.
The Vespa <a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#rank">rank query operator</a>
can be used to create a query tree, which includes a bag of features used in the wand for recall
and also other query terms to produce ranking features for first-phase/second-phase ranking.
Building on the example in <a href="advanced-ranking.html">Advanced ranking</a>,
the below uses the <em>rank</em> operator to pass a query term searching the title field for phrase.
This phrase does not impact recall,
but creates ranking features for first-phase or second-phase ranking.
<pre>
select ignoredfield from ignoredsource where rank(
    ([ {"targetNumHits": 25} ]
      wand(car_types, {"pagani":400,"lamborghini":300,"maserati":250,"ferrari":150,"lancia":50,"alfa":40,"fiat":30})),
      title contains phrase("italian", "car","makers"));
</pre>
