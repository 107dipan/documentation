<p>
Vespa document processing is a flexible framework that allows one to
create reusable components (called <em>document processors</em>), that
read and modify document operations, and compose chains of many such
components to carry out the total processing needs of an application.
</p><p>
This has many use cases. The most common case is where a property has
some input data that is to be stored in Vespa Storage, or indexed in
Vespa Search, or both.
</p><p>
The input source, typically a crawler, a stream of incoming mail, data
generated from user actions, or basically anything else, is able to
split the input data into logical units, called <em>documents</em>. A
<a href="writing-to-vespa.html">feeder application</a>
will then send these documents into a document processing chain.
</p><p>
This chain is basically an ordered list of document processors, where
each processor has one specific task. This can be anything - examples
range from things like language detection, HTML removal and natural
language processing to mail attachment processing, character set
transcoding and image thumbnailing.
</p><p>
At the end of the processing chain, extracted data will typically be
set in some fields in the document, which will continue into Vespa
Search or Vespa Storage.

<h2 id="design-goals">Design goals</h2>
<p>
The framework is designed to meet these goals:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Developer friendliness</strong>. It must be so simple to
      write a simple processor that anybody can do it. This is a complete processor:
<pre>
import com.yahoo.document.*;
import com.yahoo.docproc.*;

public class ExampleDocumentProcessor extends DocumentProcessor {

    public Progress process(Processing processing) {
        for (DocumentOperation op : processing.getDocumentOperations()) {
            if (op instanceof DocumentPut) {
                Document document = ((DocumentPut) op).getDocument();
                //TODO do something to 'document' here
            } else if (op instanceof DocumentUpdate) {
                DocumentUpdate update = (DocumentUpdate) op;
                //TODO do something to 'update' here
            } else if (op instanceof DocumentRemove) {
                DocumentRemove remove = (DocumentRemove) op;
                //TODO do something to 'remove' here
            }
        }
        return Progress.DONE;
    }
}
</pre></li>

<li><strong>Gradual learning</strong>. More advanced concepts needed
    for processing multiple documents or document updates, making
    control decisions and so on builds on, and extends naturally the
    basic concepts learned when doing simple processing.</li>

<li><strong>Scaling</strong>. The framework must allow cheap scaling
    by document size, document count and document processing clock
    time. The document processing framework uses a completely
    asynchronous architecture to allow scaling in several of these
    dimensions at the same time.</li>

<li><strong>Simplicity</strong>. The core framework consists of less
    than ten classes totaling less than thousand lines of source. It
    has one dependency - to a minimal document model (a few more
    classes) modelling documents as a named map of fields.</li>

<li><strong>Embedding</strong>. The framework does not make any
    assumptions about the context in which it will run. It can be
    embedded in another application which handles the thread
    management, configuration and so on.</li>

<li><strong>Vespa integration.</strong> The framework may also run as
    a Vespa service. Configuration through Vespa, logging to Vespa and
    remote capabilities are handled by optional add-on packages.</li>

<li><strong>Plugin support</strong>. Document processors developed by
    applications can be deployed and un-deployed in the framework, run
    without compromising the framework instance even if they contain
    errors, and be binary compatible across different versions of the
    framework. This is handled by developing the framework in Java and
    loading the document processors as OSGi components.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="core-features">Core Features</h2>
<p>
The framework core supports asynchronous processing, processing one or
multiple documents or document updates at the same time,
document processors that makes dynamic decisions about the processing flow and
passing of information between processors outside the document or document update:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>One or more named <strong>Docproc Services</strong> may be created.
    One of the services is the <em>default</em>.</li>

  <li>A service accepts subclasses of <strong>DocumentOperation</strong>
      for processing, which currently
      means <strong>DocumentPuts</strong>, <strong>DocumentUpdates</strong>
      and <strong>DocumentRemoves</strong>. It has a <strong>Call
      Stack</strong> which lists the calls to make to
      various <strong>Document Processors</strong> to process each
      DocumentOperation handed to the service.</li>

  <li>Call Stacks consist of <strong>Calls</strong>, which refer to
      the Document Processor instance to call.</li>

  <li>DocumentPuts and document updates are processed asynchronously, the
      state is kept in a Processing for its duration (instead of in a
      thread or process). A Document Processor may make some
      asynchronous calls (typically to remote services) and return to
      the framework that it should be called again later for the same
      Processing to handle the outcome of the calls.</li>

  <li>A processing contains its own copy of the Call Stack of the
      Docproc Service to keep track of what to call next.  Document
      Processors may modify this Call Stack to dynamically decide the
      processing steps required to process a DocumentOperation.</li>

  <li>A Processing may contain one or more DocumentOperations to be
      processed as a unit.</li>

  <li>A Processing has a <em>context</em>, which is a Map of named
      values which can be used to pass arguments between processors.</li>

  <li>Processings are prepared to be stored to disk to allow a very
      high number of ongoing long-term processings per node.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="additional-features">Additional Features</h2>
<p>
Outside the common core, there are optional packages which provides the following:
<ul>
<li>Configuration using Vespa Configuration. Docproc Services with
    Call Stacks can be configured from file or a configuration server
    using the Vespa Configuration System. Document processors may also
    easily get own sub Call Stacks configured using the configuration system.</li>
</ul>
