title: "Reindexing"

<p>
When the indexing pipeline of a Vespa application changes, Vespa may automatically
refeed stored data such that the index is updated according to the new specification. 
Changes in the indexing pipeline may be due to changes in external libraries, e.g., for
linguistics, or due to changes in the configuration done by the user, such as 
the <a href="/documentation/reference/advanced-indexing-language">indexing script</a>
in a document's schema, or the
<a href="/documentation/reference/services-content#document.mode">indexing mode</a>
of a document type in a content cluster.
Reindexing can be triggered for an application's full corpus, for only certain content
clusters, or for only certain document types in certain clusters, using the
<a href="/documentation/cloudconfig/deploy-rest-api-v2#reindex">reindex endpoint</a>,
and inspected at the
<a href="/documentation/cloudconfig/deploy-rest-api-v2#reindexing">reindexing endpoint</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="when-to-reindex">When to reindex</h2> 
<p>
When deployment results in a change in the indexing pipeline of an application, this is
discovered by the config server. (See the
<a href="/documentation/cloudconfig/deploy-rest-api-v2#prepare-session">prepare endpoint</a>
for details.) If the change is to be deployed, a
<a href="/documenation/reference/validation-overrides">validation override</a> must be added
to the application package. Deployment will then list the <em>reindex actions</em> required to
make the index reflect the new indexing pipeline. Use the
<a href="/documentation/cloudconfig/deploy-rest-api-v2#reindex">reindex endpoint</a>
to trigger reindexing of affected document types, <strong>but only after the new indexing
  pipeline is successfully deployed</strong>, i.e., when the application has converged on
the config generation that introduced the change. Reindexing then commences with the next
deployment of the application. 
</p>

<h3 id="reindexing-progress">Reindexing progress</h3> 
<p>
Reindexing is done by a component in each content cluster that
<a href="/documentation/content/visiting">visits</a> 
all documents of the indicated types, and refeeds these through the
<a href="/documentation/indexing#chain-indexing">indexing chain</a> of the cluster.
(Note that only the
<a href="/documentation/reference/schema-reference.html#document">document fields</a>
are refed — all derived fields, produced by the indexing pipeline, are recomputed.)
Since reindexing can be both lengthy and resource consuming, depending on the corpus, the
process is tuned to yield resources to other tasks, such as external feed and serving,
and should generally be safe to run in the background. 
</p>
<p>
Reindexing is done for one document type at a time, in parallel across content clusters. 
Detailed progress can be found at the
<a href="/documentation/cloudconfig/deploy-rest-api-v2#reindexing">reindexing endpoint</a>.
If state is <em>failed</em>, reindexing will not be retried for that document type until
triggered again. State <em>pending</em> indicates reindexing will start, or resume, when
the cluster is ready, while <em>running</em> means it's currently progressing. Finally,
<em>successful</em> means all documents of that type were successfully reindexed.
