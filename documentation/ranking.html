<p>Vespa can compute one or more <i>ranking expressions</i> for every document matching a query.
The results of the computations can be returned with the documents and used to order and thus further select
the documents that should be returned.
Ranking expressions are mathematical functions over <a href="tensor-intro.html">tensors</a> or scalars.
The function may contain anything
from a single reference to a built-in feature to a machine-learned models from
<a href="tensorflow.html">Tensorflow</a>, <a href="onnx.html">ONNX</a> or <a href="xgboost.html">XGBoost</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="ranking-expressions-and-rank-features">Ranking expressions and rank features</h2>

<p>Vespa computes the rank score by a configured mathematical expression
called a <a href="reference/ranking-expressions.html">ranking expression</a>.
Ranking expressions look like standard mathematical expressions
and support the usual operators and functions as well as an <code>if</code>
function which allows decision trees and conditional business logic and
a <a href="reference/tensor.html">comprehensive set of tensor functions</a>,
which allows expression of machine-learned functions such as deep neural nets.</p>

<p>The primitive values which are combined by ranking expressions are
called <em>rank features</em>.  Rank features are constants set in the
application package, values sent with the query or set in the document,
or they are computed by Vespa from the query and the document
to provide information about how well the query matched the document.
The rank features may be both scalars and tensors.
See the <a href="reference/rank-features.html">full list of rank features</a>
</p>


<h2 id="two-phase-ranking">Two-phase ranking</h2>

<p>Rank scores in general become more accurate by using complex
expressions which use many features or large tensors. But even though
Vespa is heavily optimized for such calculations, complex
expressions become expensive when they must be calculated for each
selected document. For this reason Vespa can
be configured to run two ranking expressions - a smaller and less
accurate one on all matches as they are found (first-phase ranking)
and a more expensive and accurate one only on the best documents
(second-phase ranking). This often provides a more optimal usage of
the cpu budget by dedicating more of the total cpu towards the best
candidates.</p>

<p>Second-phase ranking, if specified, will by default be run on the 100
best hits on each content node, after matching and before information
is returned upwards to the container. The number of hits to rerank can be
configured in the ranking expression.</p>



<h2 id="configuring-rank-expressions">Configuring rank expressions</h2>

<p>Rank expressions are configured in the <code>rank profile</code> section of
<a href="reference/search-definitions-reference.html#rank-profile">search definitions</a>. Example:

<pre>
search myapp {

    &hellip;

    rank-profile default inherits default {

        first-phase {
            expression: nativeRank + query(deservesFreshness) * freshness(timestamp)
        }

        second-phase {
            expression {
                0.7 * ( 0.7*fieldMatch(title) + 0.2*fieldMatch(description) + 0.1*fieldMatch(body) ) +
                0.3 * attributeMatch(keywords)
            }
            rerank-count: 200
        }
    }
}
</pre>

In this example, the first phase uses the single nativeRank feature
as the ranking expression plus a freshness component, where the
contribution from the freshness feature is determined by a query parameter.
The second phase uses a ranking expression which combines the match features of a few fields,
and also specifies that the second phase should happen
for the 200 best hits per node instead of the default 100
(in a real application this expression would usually be very large, or use tensors).
</p>

<p>If the ranking expressions become too large to write on a single
line, they can be wrapped in curly braces, or put in separate files in
the application package an referred by <code>file:filename</code> in
place of the expression. It is also possible to set configuration
values to change how the rank features are calculated, and specify
which rank feature values should be included in the hit information sent to the search container.
See the <a href="reference/search-definitions-reference.html#rank-profile">rank profiles</a>
reference for details.</p>

<p>When ranking expressions are changed or added, the changes can be
deployed by redeploying the application package. There is no need for
any restarting or reindexing.</p>

<p>Note that it is possible to specify multiple rank profiles and choose
between them in the query, for example to use different ranking
expressions for different use cases or to bucket test new revisions. 
A rank profile may also <code>inherit</code> another to allow specifying 
only the differences between two profiles.</p>


<h2 id="advanced-ranking-functions-using-tensors">Advanced ranking functions using tensors</h2>

<p>Many modern machine-learning methods such as neural nets and large logistic regressions
produce functions with thousands to millions of parameters. Vespa features a
native <i>tensor</i> model and operator set which makes it possible to express such
functions succinctly as ranking expressions, which Vespa will execute as optimized code
to compute a score for each document. See 
<a href="tensor-user-guide.html">the tensor user guide</a> for more.


<h2 id="choosing-ranking-expressions">Choosing ranking expressions</h2>

<p>There are two methods for deciding ranking expressions for your
application.
</p>

<p><em>The first method</em> is to <strong>hand write</strong> an expression which
captures the ranking you intend. For example, if you know that the
title field is more important than the body field, you can create a
ranking expression which gives more weight to that field, as in the
example above. Vespa contains some built-in convenience support for
this - weights can be set in the individual fields by <code>weight:
&lt;number&gt;</code> and the feature <code>match</code> can be used
to get a weighted average of the fieldMatch scores of each field.
The built in text matching feature
<a href="nativerank.html">nativeRank</a> has a set of tunable
parameters (including field <code>weight</code>) to control the text
matching ranking component in the overall ranking expression. The
overall ranking expression might contain other ranking dimensions than
just text match, like freshness, the quality of the document, or any
other property of the document or query.  Hand writing is fine if the
intended ranking is well defined enough to be easily mappable into a
ranking expression, or if the alternative below is too expensive.</p>

<p><em>The second method</em> is to produce the ranking expression
<strong>automatically</strong> from a <em>training set</em> - a set of document
and query pairs where a human has assessed the quality of the document
as an answer to the query. Given many (tens of thousands) of such
<em>judgements</em>, and the rank feature values for each, a machine learning
algorithm can be used to produce the ranking expression and/or
the weights of the expression (often represented in a constant tensor).</p>



<h2 id="choosing-features">Choosing features</h2>

<p>The <a href="reference/rank-features.html">rank feature
set</a> of Vespa contains a large set of low level features as well as
some higher level features. If automated training is used, all
features can often just be handed to the training algorithm to let it choose
which ones to use. Depending on the algorithm, it may be a good idea
to leave out the unnormalized features to avoid spending learning power on
having to learn to normalize these features
and determine that they really represent the same information as some of the
normalized features.</p>

<p>If the expression is written manually, it might be most convenient to
stick with using the <code>fieldMatch(<em>name</em>)</code> feature for
each field. This feature combines the more basic fieldMatch features
in a reasonable way. A good way to combine the fieldMatch score of
each field is to use a weighted average as explained above.  Another
way is to combine the field match scores using the
<code>fieldMatch(<em>name</em>).weight/significance/importance</code>
features which takes term weight or rareness or both into account and
allows a normalized score to be produced by simply summing the product
of this feature and any other normalized per-field score for each
field. In addition, some attribute value(s) must usually be included
to determine the a priori quality of each document.
</p>


<h2 id="feature-contribution-functions">Feature contribution functions</h2>

<p>The ranking features in Vespa are linear. For example the
<code>earliness</code> feature is 0 if the match is at the very end of
the field, 1 if the match is at the very start of the field, and 0.5
if the match is exactly in the middle of the field. In many cases, we
do not want the contribution of a feature to be linear with its
"goodness". For example, we may want <code>earliness</code>
to fall of quickly in the beginning as the match moves further out,
but fall of just very slowly as it nears the end of the field, from
the intuition that it matters a lot if the match is of the first word
or the twentieth in the field, but it doesn't matter as much if the
match is at the thousands or thousand-and-twentieths.</p>

<p>To achieve such things, we need to pass the feature value through a
function which turns the line into a curve matching our intent. This
is most easy if you stick to normalized fields. Then we are looking
for any function which begins and ends in the same point, f(0)=0 and
f(1)=1, but which curves in between. To get the effect described
above, we need a curve which starts almost flat and ends very
steep. One example of a function like that is:
<pre>
pow(0-x,2)
</pre>
The second number here decides how pronounced the curving is. A larger
number will make changes to higher x values even more important
relative to the same change to lower x values.
</p>


<h2 id="normalization">Normalization</h2>

<p>The rank features provided includes both features normalized to the
range 0-1 and unnormalized features like counts and positions.
Whenever possible, prefer the normalized features.
They capture the same information (and more), but are easier to use because
they can be combined more easily with other features.
In addition, try to write ranking expressions such that
the combined rank score is also normalized, for example by taking averages not sums.
The resulting normalized rank scores makes it possible to implement
relevance based blending, search assistance triggering when there are no good hits and so on.</p>



<h2 id="literal-boosting">Literal boosting</h2>
<p>
By default, Vespa does <a href="linguistics.html#stemming">stemming</a> and
<a href="linguistics.html#normalization">normalization</a>
of the words in the indexes and queries to increase recall.
Some times it helps relevance to write a ranking expression which gives a higher
score to matches where the literal form used in the query matches the
literal form used in the document.
This can be done by adding <code>rank:literal</code> to the fields in question
to turn this feature on, and writing a ranking function which accesses
features for a field names as the original field with
<code>_literal</code> appended. Example field and ranking expression:
<pre>
field title type string {
    indexing: index
    rank:     literal
}
</pre><pre>
0.9*fieldMatch(title) + 0.1*fieldMatch(title_literal)</pre>
</p>



<h2 id="if-function-and-string-equality-tests">The <code>if</code> function and string equality tests</h2>

<p>The <code>if</code> function can be used for other purposes than
encoding MLR trained decision trees. Another use is to choose
different ranking functions for different types of documents in the
same search. Ranking expressions are able to perform string equality
tests, so to choose between different ranking sub-functions based on
the value of a string attribute (say, "category"), we can
write an expression like this
<pre>
if (attribute(category)=="restaurant",<em>&hellip;restaurant function</em>, if (attribute(category)=="hotel",<em>&hellip;hotel function</em>, &hellip;))
</pre>
This method is also used automatically when multiple search
definitions are deployed to the same cluster and all is searched in
the same query to choose the ranking expression from the correct
search definition for each document.
</p><p>
By using <code>if</code> functions, we can also implement strict
tiering, where we ensure that documents having some criterions always
gets a higher score than the other documents. An example:
<pre>
if (fieldMatch(business).fieldCompleteness==1, 0.8+document.distance*0.2,
                                               if (attribute(category)=="shop", 0.6+fieldMatch(title)*0.2,
                                                                                 match*attribute(popularity)*0.6 )
</pre>
This function puts all exact matches on business names first, sorted
by geographical distance, followed by all shops sorted by title match,
followed by everything else sorted by the overall match quality and popularity.
</p>



<h2 id="weight-significance-and-connectedness">Weight, significance and connectedness</h2>

<p>It is possible to influence the values of the match features calculated by Vespa
from the query by sending weight, significance and connectedness with the query:
<table class="table">
  <thead></thead><tbody>
    <tr><th>Weight</th><td>
      Signify that some query terms are more or less important than others in matches.
      For example <code>query=large shoes!200</code> specifies that he term "shoes"
      should be twice as important for the final rank score than "large"
      (since the default weight is 100). Weight is used in
      <code><a href="reference/rank-features.html#fieldMatch(name).weight">
      fieldMatch(<em>name</em>).weight</a></code>, which can be multiplied with
      <code><a href="reference/rank-features.html#fieldMatch(name)">
      fieldMatch(<em>name</em>)</a></code> to yield a weighted score for the field, and in
      <code><a href="reference/rank-features.html#fieldMatch(name).weightedOccurrence">
      fieldMatch(<em>name</em>).weightedOccurrence</a></code>
      to get a occurrence score which is higher if higher weighted terms occurs most.
      Configure static field weights in the
      <a href="reference/search-definitions-reference.html#weight">search definition</a>.</td>
    </tr><tr><th>Significance</th><td>
      How rare a particular term is in the corpus or the language.
      This is sometimes valuable information because if a document matches a rare word,
      it might mean the document is more important than one which matches a common word.
      Significance is calculated automatically by Vespa during indexing,
      but can also be overridden by setting the significance values on the query terms
      in a <a href="searcher-development.html">Searcher component</a>.
      Significance is accessible in
      <code><a href="reference/rank-features.html#fieldMatch(name).significance">
      fieldMatch(<em>name</em>).significance</a></code>, which can be used the same way as weight.
      Weight and significance are also averaged into
      <code><a href="reference/rank-features.html#fieldMatch(name).importance">
      fieldMatch(<em>name</em>).importance</a></code> for convenience.</td>
    </tr><tr><th>Connectedness</th><td>
      Signify the degree of connection between adjacent terms in the query.
      For example, the query <code>new york newspaper</code> should have a higher connectedness
      between the terms "new" and "york" than between "york" and "newspaper" to rank documents higher
      if they contain "new york" as a phrase.
      Term connectedness is taken into account by
      <code><a href="reference/rank-features.html#fieldMatch(name).proximity">
      fieldMatch(<em>name</em>).proximity</a></code>,
      which is also an important contribution to
      <code><a href="reference/rank-features.html#fieldMatch(name)">fieldMatch(<em>name</em>)</a></code>.
      Connectedness is a normalized value which is 0.1 by default.
      It must be set by a custom Searcher,
      looking up connectivity information from somewhere - there is no query syntax for it.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</p>



<h2 id="rank-features-dumping-ranking-information-for-tuning">Rank features: dumping ranking information for tuning</h2>

<p>"All" ranking features can be included in the results for
each document by adding the <code>rankfeatures</code> flag to the
query. This is useful for tasks like recording the rank feature values
for automated training. Since the set of actual feature computable are
in general infinite, "all" features really means a large
default set. If more rank features than is available in the default
set is wanted, they can be added to the set in the rank profile:</p>

<pre>
rank-features: feature1 feature2 &hellip;
</pre>
This list can also be enclosed in curly brackets and span multiple lines.
It is also possible to take full control over which features will be dumped by adding
<pre>
ignore-default-rank-features
</pre>
to the rank profile. This will make the explicitly listed rank
features the only ones dumped when requesting rankfeatures in the
query. The features are dumped on JSON format.

<p>When you have a training set containing judgements for certain documents, it is
useful to select those documents in the query by adding a term matching the document id,
but without impacting the values of any rank features. To do this, add that term with
<code>ranked</code>code> set to false. In YQL:</p>

<pre>
select * from mydocumenttype where myidfield contains ([ {"ranked": false} ] "mydocumentid" and ...);
</pre>


<h2 id="summary-features-getting-match-information-in-the-results">Summary features: getting match information in the results</h2>

<p>As <code>rankfeatures</code> dumps way too many features to to be
usable for production, Vespa also allows a smaller number of feature
values to be returned with each result in production by specifying a
list of <em>summary features</em> in the search definition. This can be
used, for example, to write custom Searcher or presentation logic which
depends on which fields was matched and how well they matched.
See the <a href="reference/inspecting-structured-data.html"> inspecting
structured data</a> documentation for details about how to access summary
features in a custom Searcher.
A list of summary features is set per rank profile by adding:
<pre>
summary-features: feature1 feature2 &hellip;
</pre>
to the rank profile. The list can also be enclosed by curly brackets
and split into multiple lines.
</p>


<h2 id="feature-configuration">Feature configuration</h2>

<p>Some features, most notably the <code>fieldMatch</code> features,
contains configuration parameters which allows the feature calculation
to be tweaked per field for performance or relevance.
Feature configuration values are set by adding:
<pre>
rank-properties {
    featureName.configurationProperty: "value"
}
</pre>
to the rank profile. These values are set per field, so for example to
set some values for the <code>title</code> field and some others for
the <code>description</code> field, add:
<pre>
rank-properties {
    fieldMatch(title).maxAlternativeSegmentations: 10
    fieldmatch(title).maxOccurrences: 5
    fieldMatch(description).maxOccurrences: 20
}
</pre>
The full list of configuration features is found in
the <a href="reference/rank-feature-configuration.html">rank
feature configuration reference</a>.
</p>


<h2 id="choosing-functions-for-the-first-and-second-phase">Choosing functions for the first and second phase</h2>

<p>A good ranking expression will for most applications consume too much
cpu to be runnable on the entire result set, so in most cases the
desired rank function should be used as the second phase function.
The task then becomes to find a first phase function which correlates
sufficiently well with the second phase function to ensure that
relevance is not hurt too much by not evaluating the second phase
function on all the hits. In many cases, <code>nativeRank</code> will
work well as the first phase function. The impact of using a cheaper
function in the first phase can be assessed by deploying the second
order function as the first order function in a test rank profile and
comparing the results to the production rank profile.
</p>



<h2 id="performance-notes">Performance notes</h2>

<p>Evaluating ranking expressions is in itself not expensive, but
expressions returning the value of a single rank feature only are more
optimal still, so they should be preferred as first phase functions
when possible. The total latency is typically linear with the number
of hits the query matches.</p>

<p>The ranking framework will ensure that only values actually used by
rank expressions in the chosen query will be calculated and only in
the phase where they are used. Because of this, there is additional
cost in actually using features even though they are always available for use.</p>

<p>The <code>fieldMatch</code> (and hence <code>match</code>) features
contain information about the <em>best</em> matches of the query to the
field text and are quite expensive to calculate - probably not
suitable for a first phase function in most applications. It is
possible to make the fieldMatch features less expensive (and less
accurate) by setting the <code>maxAlternativeSegmentations</code>
configuration value - see
<a href="reference/string-segment-match.html#configuration-parameters">
string segmentation match configuration parameters</a>.</p>

<p>If the reranking count is turned up, more cpu will be needed to do the
reranking, but in addition more memory will be needed per query being
executed to hold temporary information needed between the first and
second phase.
</p>


<h2 id="raw-scores-and-query-item-labeling">Raw scores and query item labeling</h2>

<p>Vespa ranking is very flexible and relatively decoupled from document
matching. The output from the matching pipeline typically indicates
how the different words in the query matches a specific document and
lets the ranking framework figure out how this translates to match quality.</p>

<p>However, some of the more complex match operators will produce scores
directly rather than expose underlying match information. A good
example is the wand operator. During ranking, a wand will
look like a single word that has no detailed match information, but
rather a numeric score attached to it. This is called a <em>raw
score</em> and can be included in ranking expressions using
the <code>rawScore</code> feature.</p>

<p>The <code>rawScore</code> feature takes a field name as parameter and
will give the sum of all raw scores produced by the query for that
field. If more fine-grained control is needed (the query contains
multiple operators producing raw scores for the same field, but we
want to handle those scores separately in the ranking expression)
the <code>itemRawScore</code> feature may be used. This feature takes
a query item <em>label</em> as parameter and gives the raw score
produced by that item only.</p>

<p>Query item labeling is a generic mechanism that can be used to attach
symbolic names to query items. A query item is labeled by using
the <code>setLabel</code> method on a query item in the search
container query API.</p>


<h2 id="using-constants">Using constants</h2>

<p>Ranking expressions may refer to constants defined in a <code>constants</code> clause:
<pre>
first-phase {
    expression: myConst1 + myConst2
}
constants {
    myConst1: 1.5
    myConst2: 2.5
    ...
}
</pre>
Constants lists are inherited and can be overridden in sub-profiles.
This is useful to create a set of rank profiles that use the same broad ranking
but differs by constants values.</p>

<p>For performance, always prefer constants to query variables (see below)
whenever the constant values to use can be enumerated in a set of ranking profiles.
Constants are applied to ranking expressions at configuration time
and the resulting constant parts of expressions calculated,
which may lead to reduced execution cost, especially with tensor constants.</p>


<h2 id="using-query-variables">Using query variables</h2>

<p>Because ranking expressions may refer to any feature by name,
one can use <a href="reference/rank-features.html#feature-list">query features</a>
as ranking variables. These variables can be assigned default values in the rank profile by adding:
<pre>
rank-properties {
    query(name): "value"
}
</pre>
to the ranking profile. In addition, these variables can be overridden in the query by adding:
<pre>
rankfeature.query(name)=value
</pre>
to the HTTP query - see the <a href="reference/search-api-reference.html#ranking.features">Search API</a>.
These variables can be used for example to allow the query to specify
the degree of importance to various parts of a ranking expression, or
to quickly search large parameter spaces to find a good ranking by
trying different values in each query.
</p>


<h2 id="function-snippets-as-mlr-level-features">Function Snippets as MLR Level Features</h2>

<p>When using machine learned ranking, we are searching a function space which is much more
limited than the space of functions supported by ranking
expressions. We can increase the space of functions available to MLR
because the primitive features used in MLR training does not need to
be primitive features in Vespa - they can just as well be ranking
expression snippets.  If there are certain mathematical combinations
of features believed to be useful in an application, these can be
pre-calculated from the actual primitive features of Vespa and given
to MLR as primitives. Such primitives can then be replaced textually
by the corresponding rank expression snippet before the learned
expression is deployed on Vespa.
</p><p>
Vespa supports <em>expression functions</em>,
see <a href="reference/search-definitions-reference.html#rank-profile">reference</a>.
Functions having zero arguments can be used as summary- and rank-features. For example,
    the function "myfeature":
<pre>
rank-profile myrankprofile inherits default {
    function myfeature() {
      expression: fieldMatch(title).completeness * pow(0 - fieldMatch(title).earliness, 2)
    }
}
</pre>
becomes available as a feature as follows:
<pre>
summary-features {
    rankingExpression(myfeature@)
}
</pre>
The "rankingExpression" prefix, the parenthesis and
the trailing at-sign are all required.
</p>


<h2 id="nativerank">nativeRank</h2>

<p>The default ranking is <code>nativeRank</code> in the first phase
and no second phase re-ranking.
The <code>nativeRank</code> is a feature which gives a reasonably good rank score
while being fast enough to be suitable for first phase ranking.
See the <a href="reference/nativerank.html">native rank reference</a> and
<a href="nativerank.html">native rank introduction</a> for more information.</p>


<h2 id="tracking-relevance-variations-over-time">Tracking relevance variations over time</h2>

<p>Vespa comes with a few simple metrics for relevance that enables applications to see how 
relevance changes over time, either as a result of changes to how relevance is computed, 
changes to query construction, changes to the content ingested, or as a result of changing 
user behavior.</p>
<p>The relevance metrics are <code>relevance.at_1</code>, <code>relevance.at_3</code> 
and <code>relevance.at_10</code>. See <a href="jdisc/metrics.html">metrics</a> for more 
information.</p>
