This document describes tuning certain features of an application for high performance, 
this document mainly focus on content cluster search features, 
see <a href="container-tuning.html">Container tuning</a> for tuning of container clusters</a>.
The <a href="sizing-search.html">search sizing guide</a> is about scaling an application deployment.
</p>



<h2 id="attribute-vs-index">Attribute v.s index</h2>
<p>
The <a href="../attributes.html">attribute</a> documentation summaries when to use
<a href="../reference/search-definitions-reference.html#attribute">attribute</a>
in the <a href="../reference/search-definitions-reference.html#indexing">indexing</a> statement.
<pre>
field timestamp type long {
    indexing: summary | attribute
    rank:     filter
}
</pre>
If both index and attribute is configured for string type fields,
Vespa will do search and matching against the index with default match <samp>text</samp>.
All numeric type fields and tensor fields are attribute (in-memory) fields in Vespa.
</p>



<h2 id="when-to-use-fast-search">When to use fast-search for attribute fields</h2>
<p>
By default there Vespa does not build any posting list index structures over <em>attribute</em> fields.
Adding <em>fast-search</em> to the attribute definition as show below
will add an in-memory B-tree posting list structure
which enables faster search for some cases (but not all, see next paragraph):
<pre>
field timestamp type long {
    indexing:  summary | attribute
    attribute: fast-search
    rank:      filter
}
</pre>
When Vespa executes a query with multiple query items, it builds an query execution plan.
It then optimizes so that query tree items that are restrictive (matching few documents) are evaluated early.
This makes the temporary result set as small as possible.
To do so, the query execution plan looks at hit count estimates for each part of the query tree
using the index and b-tree dictionaries,
tracking the number of documents a given term occurs in.
However, for attribute fields without <a href="../reference/search-definitions-reference.html#attribute">fast-search</a>,
there is no hit count estimate.
The estimate hence equals the total number of documents (matches all)
and is thus moved to the end of the query evaluation.
</p><p>
A query with only one query term, searching a attribute field without <em>fast-search</em>,
will be a linear scan over all documents and thus slow:
<pre>
select * from sources * where range(timestamp, 0, 100);
</pre>
But if this query term is <em>and</em>-ed with a more restrictive query term (see section below),
the query optimizer will find that the second query term has a lower hit count estimate than the timestamp range
and the query becomes fast and scales with number of documents that matches the uuid field.
<pre>
select * from sources * where range(timestamp, 0, 100) and uuid contains "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000";
</pre>
The general rules of thumb for when to use fast-search for an attribute field is:
<ul>
  <li>Use <em>fast-search</em> if the attribute field is searched without any other query terms</li>
  <li>Use <em>fast-search</em> if the attribute field could limit the total number of hits efficiently</li>
</ul>
Changing fast-search aspect of the attribute is a
<a href="../reference/search-definitions-reference.html#modify-search-definitions">live change</a>
which does not require any re-feeding, so testing the performance with and without is low effort.
</p>



<h2 id="indexing-strings">Indexing strings</h2>
<p>
When configuring <a href="../reference/search-definitions-reference.html#type:string">string</a>
type fields with <samp>index</samp>,
the default <a href="../reference/search-definitions-reference.html#match">match</a> mode is <samp>text</samp>.
This means Vespa will <a href="../linguistics.html#tokenization">tokenize</a> the content and index the tokens.
Example document definition:
<pre>
search foo {
    document foo {
        field title type string {
            indexing: summary | index
        }
        field uuid type string {
            indexing: summary | index
        }
    }
}
</pre>
The string representation of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">
Universally unique identifier</a> (UUID) is 32 hexadecimal (base 16) digits,
in five groups, separated by hyphens, in the form 8-4-4-4-12,
for a total of 36 characters (32 alphanumeric characters and four hyphens).
</p><p>
Example: Indexing <samp>123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000</samp> with the above document definition,
Vespa will tokenize this into 5 tokens: <samp>[123e4567,e89b,12d3,a456,426655440000]</samp>.
</p><p>
Phrase search is evaluated over positional indicies
and has a higher cost compared to searching for a single word term.
Vespa creates implicit phrases when terms are joined by hyphens.
Hence <samp>/search/?query=uuid:123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000</samp>
becomes a phrase query: <samp>uuid:"123e4567 e89b12d3 a456 426655440000"</samp>.
</p><p>
Change the mode to <a href="../reference/search-definitions-reference.html#word">match: word</a> to disable tokenization.
This stores the input <samp>123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000</samp> as one token and avoids implicit phrase search:
<pre>
field uuid type string {
    indexing: summary | index
    match:    word
    rank:     filter
}
</pre>
Also configure <samp>uuid</samp> as a <a href="../reference/search-definitions-reference.html#filter">rank: filter</a> field -
the field will then be represented as efficient as possible during search and ranking.
</p><p>
Summary: Review the string fields in the application:
<ul>
  <li>tokenized matching or not</li>
  <li>used in ranking or not</li>
</ul>
The <samp>rank:filter</samp> behavior can also be triggered at query time on a per query item basis
by the <samp>com.yahoo.prelude.query.Item.setRanked()</samp>
in a <a href="../searcher-development.html">custom searcher</a>.
</p>



<h2 id="parent-child-and-search-performance">Parent child and search performance</h2>
<p>
When searching imported attribute fields from parent document types
there is an additional cost penalty which can be reduced significantly
if the imported field is defined with <samp>rank:filter</samp>
and <a href="../reference/services-content.html#visibility-delay">visibility-delay</a> is configured to &gt; 0.
</p>



<h2 id="ranking-and-ml-model-inferences">Ranking and ML Model inferences</h2>
<p>
Vespa <a href="sizing-search.html">scales</a> with the number of hits the query retrieves per node/search thread,
and which needs to be evaluated by the first-phase ranking function.
Read more on <a href="../phased-ranking.html">phased ranking</a>.
Using phased ranking enables spending more resources during a second phase ranking step than in the first-phase.
The first-phase should be focused on getting decent recall (retrieve relevant documents in the top k),
while second phase is used to tune precision at k,
bringing the relevant documents to the top of the result set.
</p><p>
For <a href="../text-ranking.html">text ranking</a> applications,
consider using the <a href="../using-wand-with-vespa.html">WAND</a> query operator -
WAND can efficiently find the top k documents using a linear ranking function (inner dot product).
</p>



<h2 id="document-summaries-hits">Document summaries - hits</h2>
<p>
If queries request many hits from a few content nodes,
a <a href="caches-in-vespa.html">summary cache</a> might reduce latency and cost.
</p><p>
Using <a href="../document-summaries.html">Document summaries</a>,
Vespa can support memory-only operations if fields in the summary are defined as <em>attribute</em>.
</p>



<h2 id="boolean-numeric-text-attribute">Boolean, numeric, text attribute</h2>
<p>
When selecting attribute field type, considering performance, this is a rule of thumb:
<ol>
  <li>Use boolean if a field is a boolean (max two values)</li>
  <li>Use a string attribute if there is a set of values - only unique strings are stored</li>
  <li>Use a numeric attribute for range searches</li>
</ol>
Refer to <a href="attribute-memory-usage.html">attribute memory usage</a> for details.
