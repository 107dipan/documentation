title: "Vespa Search Performance Tuning"
---
<p>
This document describes how to tune your application for high performance
while <a href="sizing-search.html">search sizing guide</a> discuss how to scale an application.
</p>



<h2 id="attribute-vs-index">Attribute v.s index</h2>
<p>
The <a href="../attributes.html">attribute</a> documentation summaries when to use <samp>attribute</samp>
in the <a href="../reference/search-definitions-reference.html#indexing">indexing</a> statement.
Adding <samp>attribute:fast-search</samp> will speed up searches over attribute fields,
by building an in-memory index over the values in the attribute field.
<pre>
field timestamp type long {
    indexing:  summary | attribute
    attribute: fast-search
    rank:      filter
}
</pre>
If both index and attribute is configured for string type fields,
Vespa will do search and matching against the index with default match <samp>text</samp>.
</p>



<h2 id="indexing-strings">Indexing strings</h2>
<p>
When configuring <a href="../reference/search-definitions-reference.html#type:string">string</a>
type fields with <samp>index</samp>,
the default <a href="../reference/search-definitions-reference.html#match">match</a> mode is <samp>text</samp>.
This means Vespa will tokenize the content and index the tokens.
Example document definition:
<pre>
search foo {
    document foo {
        field title type string {
            indexing: summary | index
        }
        field uuid type string {
            indexing: summary | index
        }
    }
}
</pre>
The string representation of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">
Universally unique identifier</a> (UUID) is 32 hexadecimal (base 16) digits,
in five groups, separated by hyphens, in the form 8-4-4-4-12,
for a total of 36 characters (32 alphanumeric characters and four hyphens).
</p><p>
Example: Indexing <samp>123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000</samp> with the above document definition,
Vespa will tokenize this into 5 tokens: <samp>[123e4567,e89b,12d3,a456,426655440000]</samp>.
</p><p>
Phrase search is evaluated over positional indicies
and has a higher cost compared to searching for a single word term.
Vespa creates implicit phrases when terms are joined by hyphens.
Hence <samp>/search/?query=uuid:123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000</samp>
becomes a phrase query: <samp>uuid:"123e4567 e89b12d3 a456 426655440000"</samp>.
</p><p>
Change the match mode to <samp>word</samp> to disable tokenization.
This will store the input <samp>123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000</samp> as one token
and avoid implicit phrase search:
<pre>
field uuid type string {
    indexing: summary | index
    match:    word
    rank:     filter
}
</pre>
Also configure <samp>uuid</samp> as a <a href="../reference/search-definitions-reference.html#filter">rank:filter</a> field -
the field will then be represented as efficient as possible during search and ranking.
</p><p>
Summary: Review the string fields in the application:
<ul>
  <li>tokenized matching or not</li>
  <li>used in ranking or not</li>
</ul>
The <samp>rank:filter</samp> behavior can also be triggered at query time on a per query item basis
by the <samp>com.yahoo.prelude.query.Item.setRanked()</samp>
in a <a href="../searcher-development.html">custom searcher</a>.
</p>



<h2 id="parent-child-and-search-performance">Parent child and search performance</h2>
<p>
When searching imported attribute fields from parent document types
there is an additional cost penalty which can be reduced significantly
if the imported field is defined with <samp>rank:filter</samp>
and <a href="../reference/services-content.html#visibility-delay">visibility-delay</a> is configured to &gt; 0.
</p>



<h2 id="ranking">Ranking</h2>
<p>
<a href="sizing-search.html">Vespa scales</a> with the number of hits the query recalls
which needs to be ranked per node.
The ranking cost per document recalled is determined by the complexity of the ranking expression in use
and the rank feature complexity.
</p>



<h2 id="document-summaries">Document summaries</h2>
<p>
If queries request many hits from a few content nodes,
a <a href="caches-in-vespa.html">summary cache</a> might reduce cost.
</p><p>
<a href="../document-summaries.html">Document summaries</a> can be memory-only operations is all fields are attributes.
Use a <a href="../reference/search-api-reference.html#presentation.summary">summary class</a>
to request <samp>attribute</samp> fields only.
If summary performance is the suspected bottleneck,
test using the internal reserved document summary, which contains all single-valued attribute fields,
by benchmarking with <samp>&amp;summary=attributeprefetch</samp>.
This avoids disk access entirely.
