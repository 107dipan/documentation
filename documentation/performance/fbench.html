This is the HTML version of the man page for the command line tool <em>vespa-fbench</em> -
a tool used for benchmarking the capacity of a Vespa system. Description:
<ul>
  <li>Several hostnames and ports can be listed</li>
  <!-- ToDo: make sure we have an example using multiple hosts -->
  <li>This is distributed in round-robin manner to clients</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="using-prepare">Preparing query files</h2>
<p>
Fbench uses <em>query files</em>, which are files where each line
is a query following the pattern:
</p>
<pre>/search/?query=<em>sddocname:music&amp;nocache</em></pre>

<p>It is often desirable to collect queries from a live system</p>

<p class="alert alert-success">
Adding "&amp;nocache" to each query will force the search container to request
results from the search nodes.  This parameter is recommended if the
query set for benchmarking is small, otherwise the benchmark results
will be biased by the caching performance of the container.
</p>

<h2 id="using-fbench">Run vespa-fbench</h2>
<p>It is recommended to run multiple tests by changing the value in
<code>-n</code> parameter to measure how the system might sustain
query load and still meet the QPS and/or latency requirements. For
example, starting from 1 client, 10, 20, etc.</p>

<p>A typical vespa-fbench command looks like:</p>
<pre>
$ vespa-fbench -n 10 -q query%03d.txt -s 300 -c 0 -o output%03d.txt -xy test.domain.com 8080
</pre>


<p>This creates 10 clients which will run for 300 seconds (5 minutes). The
<code>-c</code> parameter states that each client will wait for 0
milliseconds between each request. Each client would use a query and
output file given by the given pattern and it's client number,
i.e. client 1 will use query file query001.txt and output file output001.txt.</p>

<p>The options <code>-xy</code> makes vespa-fbench clients output
benchmarking data to it's output files</p>

<p class="alert alert-success">
It is possible to list several hostnames and ports. The different
hostnames will be distributed to the clients in a round-robin manner,
such that, with two hosts, client 0, 2, &hellip;, 38 would make requests to
the first host while client 1, 3, &hellip;, 39 would make requests to the
second host.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-success">
Note that saving all responses to disk might impact the performance of
the benchmarking itself. If only the summary is needed it is
recommended to not use output files.
</p>

<h2 id="using-post">Using vespa-fbench results</h2>
<p>
After running vespa-fbench you will have a summary written to stdout and an
output file from each client.
</p>


<h3 id="results">Understanding benchmarking results</h3>
<p>After a test run has completed, vespa-fbench outputs various test
results. This section will explain what each of these numbers mean. Notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    'system utilization' provides no information about the Vespa
  system under test and should not be used for benchmarking
  </li><li>
    In some modes of operation, vespa-fbench waits before sending the next query
  </li><li>
    'system utilization' represents the time that vespa-fbench is
    sending queries and waiting for responses. For example,
    a 'system utilization' of 50% means that vespa-fbench is stress testing the system 50% of the time,
    and is doing nothing the remaining 50% of the time
  </li><li>
    Do not run vespa-fbench on the same machine as the container
    or the search node because it will impact the performance of vespa system
  </li><li>
    vespa-fbench latency results include network latency.
    Measure and subtract network latency to obtain the true vespa query latency.
    See also <a href="#results-extended-1">extended results</a> for this info from Vespa
  </li><li>
    If many of the queries return zero results, the average latency will be low</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="results-basic">Basic results</h3>
<table class="table">
  <thead></thead><tbody>
    <tr>
<th style="width:200px">connection reuse count</th>
<td> This value indicates how many times HTTP
     connections were reused to issue another
     request. Note that this number will only be
     displayed if the -k switch (enable HTTP
     keep-alive) is used.
</td>
    </tr><tr>

<th>clients</th>
<td> Echo of the -n parameter.</td>
    </tr><tr>

<th>cycle time</th>
<td> Echo of the -c parameter.</td>
    </tr><tr>

<th>lower response limit</th>
<td> Echo of the -l parameter.</td>
    </tr><tr>

<th>skipped requests</th>
<td> Number of requests that was skipped
by vespa-fbench. vespa-fbench will typically skip a request if the line containing
the query url exceeds a pre-defined limit. Skipped requests will have
minimal impact on the statistical results.</td>
    </tr><tr>

<th>failed requests</th>
<td> The number of failed requests. A
request will be marked as failed if en error occurred while reading
the result or if the result contained less bytes than 'lower response
limit'.</td>
    </tr><tr>

<th>successful requests</th>
<td> Number of successful
requests. Each performed request is counted as either successful or
failed. Skipped requests (see above) are not performed and therefore
not counted.</td>
    </tr><tr>

<th>cycles not held</th>
<td> Number of cycles not held. The cycle
time is specified with the -c parameter. It defines how often a client
should perform a new request. However, a client may not perform
another request before the result from the previous request has been
obtained. Whenever a client is unable to initiate a new request 'on
time' due to not being finished with the previous request, this value
will be increased.</td>
    </tr><tr>

<th>minimum response time</th>
<td> The minimum response time. The
response time is measured as the time period from just before the
request is sent to the server, till the result is obtained from the
server.</td>
    </tr><tr>

<th>maximum response time</th>
<td> The maximum response time. The
response time is measured as the time period from just before the
request is sent to the server, till the result is obtained from the
server.</td>
    </tr><tr>

<th>average response time</th>
<td> The average response time. The
response time is measured as the time period from just before the
request is sent to the server, till the result is obtained from the
server.</td>
    </tr><tr>

<th>X percentile</th>
<td> The X percentile of the response time
samples; a value selected such that X percent of the response time
samples are below this value. In order to calculate percentiles, a
histogram of response times is maintained for each client at runtime
and merged after the test run ends. If a percentile value exceeds the
upper bound of this histogram, it will be approximated (and thus less
accurate) and marked with '(approx)'.</td>
    </tr><tr>

<th>actual query rate</th>
<td> The average number of queries per
second; QPS.</td>
    </tr><tr>

<th>utilization</th>
<td> The percentage of time used waiting for
the server to complete (successful) requests. Note that if a request
fails, the utilization will drop since the client has 'wasted' the
time spent on the failed request.</td>
    </tr><tr>

<th>zero hit queries</th>
<td>The number of queries that gave zero hits in Vespa</td>
    </tr>
